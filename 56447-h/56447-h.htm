<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">iriam</span> paused with her heavy bag dragging at her
arm. It was a disaster. But it was the last of
Mornington Road. To explain about it would be to bring
Mornington Road here.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter now&rdquo; said Mrs. Bailey as she dropped
her bag and fumbled for her purse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d better settle it at once or I shall forget about
it. I&rsquo;m so glad the things have come so soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Bailey had taken the half-crown they stood
smiling at each other. Mrs. Bailey looked exactly as she had
done the first time. It was exactly the same; there was
no disappointment. The light coming through the glass
above the front door made her look more shabby and worn.
Her hair was more metallic. But it was the same girlish
figure and the same smile triumphing over the badly fitting
teeth. Miriam felt like an inmate returning after an
absence. The smeariness of the marble-topped hall table
did not offend her. She held herself in. It was better to
begin as she meant to go on. Behind Mrs. Bailey the staircase
was beckoning. There was something waiting upstairs
that would be gone if she stayed talking to Mrs.
Bailey.
</p>

<p>
Assuring Mrs. Bailey that she remembered the way to the
room she started at last on the journey up the many flights
<a id="page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
of stairs. The feeling of confidence that had come the
first time she mounted them with Mrs. Bailey returned now.
She could not remember noticing anything then but a large
brown dinginess, one rich warm even tone everywhere in the
house; a sharp contrast to the cold harshly lit little bedroom
in Mornington Road. The day was cold. But this
house did not seem cold and when she rounded the first
flight and Mrs. Bailey was out of sight the welcome of the
place fell upon her. She knew it well, better than any place
she had known in all her wanderings&mdash;the faded umbers and
browns of the stair carpet, the gloomy heights of wall, a
patternless sheen where the staircase lights fell upon it and
in the shadowed parts a blurred scrolling pattern in dull
madder on a brown background; the dark landings with
lofty ceilings and high dark polished doors surmounted
by classical reliefs in grimed plaster, the high staircase
windows screened by long smoke grimed lace curtains. On
the top landing the ceiling came down nearly level with the
tops of the doors. The light from above made the little
grained doors stare brightly. Patches of fresh brown and
buff shone here and there in the threadbare linoleum. The
cracks of the flooring were filled with dust and dust lay
along the rim of the skirting. Two large tin trunks standing
one upon the other almost barred the passage way. It
was like a landing in a small suburban lodging-house, a small
silent afternoon brightness, shut in and smelling of dust.
Silence flooded up from the lower darkness. The hall
where she had stood with Mrs. Bailey was far away below
and below that were basements deep in the earth. The
outside of the house with its first-floor balcony, the broad
shallow flight of steps leading to the dark green front door,
the little steep flight running sharply down into the railed
area seemed as far away as yesterday.
</p>

<p>
The little landing was a bright plateau, under the skylight,
shut off by its brightness from the rest of the house,
the rooms leading from it would be bright and flat and
noisy with light compared with the rest of the house.
<a id="page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
From above came the tap-tap of a door swinging gently
in a breeze and behind the sound was a soft faint continuous
murmur. She ran up the short twisting flight of bare stairs
into a blaze of light. Would her room be a bright suburban
bedroom? Had it been a dull day when she first called?
The skylight was blue and gold with light, its cracks
threads of bright gold. Three little glaring yellow grained
doors opened on to the small strip of uncovered dusty
flooring; to the left the little box-loft, to the right the
empty garret behind her own and in front of her her own
door ajar; tapping in the breeze. The little brass knob
rattled loosely in her hand and the hinge ran up the scale
to a high squeak as she pushed open the door and down
again as it closed behind her neatly with a light wooden
sound. The room was half dark shadow and half brilliant
light.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-2">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
She closed the door and stood just inside it looking at
the room. It was smaller than her memory of it. When
she had stood in the middle of the floor with Mrs. Bailey
she had looked at nothing but Mrs. Bailey, waiting for
the moment to ask about the rent. Coming upstairs she
had felt the room was hers and barely glanced at it when
Mrs. Bailey opened the door. From the moment of waiting
on the stone steps outside the front door everything had
opened to the movement of her impulse. She was surprised
now at her familiarity with the detail of the room ...
that idea of visiting places in dreams. It was something
more than that ... all the real part of your life has a real
dream in it; some of the real dream part of you coming
true. You know in advance when you are really following
your life. These things are familiar because reality is here.
Coming events cast <em>light</em>. It is like dropping everything
and walking backwards to something you know is there.
However far you go out you come back.... I am back
now where I was before I began trying to do things like
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
other people. I left home to get here. None of those
things can touch me here. They are mine....
</p>

<p>
... The room asserted its chilliness. But the dark
yellow graining of the wall-paper was warm. It shone
warmly in the stream of light pouring through the barred
lattice window. In the further part of the room darkened
by the steep slope of the roof it gleamed like stained wood.
The window space was a little square wooden room, the long
low double lattice breaking the roof, the ceiling and walls
warmly reflecting its oblong of bright light. Close against
the window was a firm little deal table covered with a thin
brightly coloured printed cotton tablecloth. When Miriam
drew her eyes from its confusion of rich fresh tones the
bedroom seemed very dark. The bed drawn in under
the slope showed an expanse of greyish white counterpane,
the carpet was colourless in the gloom. She opened the
door. Silence came in from the landing. The blue and gold
had gone from the skylight. Its sharp grey light shone
in over the dim colours of the threadbare carpet and on
to the black bars of the little grate and the little strip of
tarnished yellow grained mantelpiece, running along to
the bedhead where a small globeless gas bracket stuck out
at an angle over the head of the bed. The sight of her
luggage piled up on the other side of the fireplace drew
her forward into the dimness. There was a small chest
of drawers battered and almost paintless but with two
long drawers and two small ones and a white cover on which
stood a little looking glass framed in polished pine ...
and a small yellow wardrobe with a deep drawer under the
hanging part and a little drawer in the rickety little washstand
and another above the dusty cupboard of the little
mahogany sideboard. I&rsquo;ll paint the bright part of the
ceiling; scrolls of leaves.... Shutting the quiet door
she went into the brilliance of the window space. The outside
world appeared; a long row of dormer windows and
the square tops of the larger windows below them, the
windows black or sheeny grey in the light, cut out against
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
the dinginess of smoke grimed walls. The long strip of
roof sloping back from the dormers was a pure even dark
grey. She bent to see the sky, clear soft heavy grey, striped
by the bars of her window. Behind the top rim of the iron
framework of the bars was a discoloured roll of window
blind. Then the bars must move.... Shifting the table
she pressed close to the barred window. It smelt strongly
of rust and dust. Outside she saw grey tiles sloping steeply
from the window to a cemented gutter beyond which was a
little stone parapet about two feet high. A soft wash of
madder lay along the grey tiles. There must be an afterglow
somewhere, just out of sight. Her hands went through
the bars and lifted the little rod which held the lattice
half open. The little square four paned frame swung free
and flattened itself back against the fixed panes, out of
reach, its bar sticking out over the leads. Drawing back
grimed fingers and wrists striped with grime she grasped
the iron bars and pulled. The heavy framework left the
window frame with a rusty creak and the sound of paint
peeling and cracking. It was very heavy but it came up
and up until her arms were straight above her head and
looking up she saw a stout iron ring in a little trap door
in the wooden ceiling and a hook in the centre of the endmost
bar in the iron framework.
</p>

<p>
Kneeling on the table to raise the frame once more and
fix it to the ceiling she saw the whole length of the top
row of windows across the way and wide strips of grimy
stucco placed across the house fronts between the windows.
</p>

<p>
The framework of the freed window was cracked and
blistered but the little square panes were clean. There
were four little windows in the row, each with four square
panes. The outmost windows were immovable. The one
next to the open one had lost its bar, but a push set it free
and it swung wide. She leaned out holding back from the
dusty sill and met a soft fresh breeze streaming straight in
from the west. The distant murmur of traffic changed
into the clear plonk plonk and rumble of swift vehicles.
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
Right and left at the far end of the vista were glimpses of
bare trees. The cheeping of birds came faintly from the
distant squares and clear and sharp from neighbouring
roofs. To the left the trees were black against pure grey,
to the right they stood spread and bunched in front of the
distant buildings blocking the vista. Running across the
rose-washed façade of the central mass she could just make
out &ldquo;Edwards&rsquo;s Family Hotel&rdquo; in large black letters.
That was the distant view of the courtyard of Euston
Station.... In between that and the square of trees ran
the Euston Road, by day and by night, her unsleeping
guardian, the rim of the world beyond which lay the
northern suburbs, banished.
</p>

<p>
From a window somewhere down the street out of sight
came the sound of an unaccompanied violin, clearly attacking
and dropping and attacking a passage of half a dozen
bars. The music stood serene and undisturbed in the air
of the quiet street. The man was following the phrase,
listening; strengthening and clearing it, completely undisturbed
and unconscious of his surroundings. &lsquo;Good
heavens&rsquo; she breathed quietly, feeling the extremity of
relief, passing some boundary, emerging strong and equipped
in a clear medium.... She turned back into the twilight
of the room. Twenty-one and only one room to hold the
richly renewed consciousness, and a living to earn, but the
self that was with her in the room was the untouched
tireless self of her seventeenth year and all the earlier
time. The familiar light moved within the twilight, the
old light.... She might as well wash the grime from
her wrists and hands. There was a scrap of soap in the
soap dish, dry and cracked and seamed with dirt. The
washstand rocked as she washed her hands; the toilet
things did not match, the towel-horse held one small thin
face towel and fell sideways against the wardrobe as she
drew off the towel. When the gas was on she would be visible
from the opposite dormer window. Short skimpy faded
Madras muslin curtains screened a few inches of the endmost
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
windows and were caught back and tied up with tape.
She untied the tape and disengaged with the curtains a
strong smell of dust. The curtains would cut off some of
the light. She tied them firmly back and pulled at the edge
of the rolled up blind. The blind streaked and mottled
with ironmould came down in a stifling cloud of dust. She
rolled it up again and washed once more. She must ask
for a bath towel and do something about the blind, sponge
it or something; that was all.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-3">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
A light had come in the dormer on the other side of the
street. It remained unscreened. Watching carefully she
could see only a dim figure moving amongst motionless
shapes. No need to trouble about the blind. London could
come freely in day and night through the unscreened happy
little panes; light and darkness and darkness and light.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
London, just outside all the time, coming in with the
light, coming in with the darkness, always present in the
depths of the air in the room.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-4">

<p class="noindent">
The gas flared out into a wide bright flame. The dingy
ceiling and counterpane turned white. The room was a
square of bright light and had a rich brown glow, shut
brightly in by the straight square of level white ceiling
and thrown up by the oblong that sloped down, white,
at the side of the big bed almost to the floor. She left
her things half unpacked about the floor and settled herself
on the bed under the gas jet with the Voyage of the
Beagle. Unpacking had been a distraction from the glory,
very nice, getting things straight. But there was no <em>need</em>
to do anything or think about anything ... ever, here.
No interruption, no one watching or speculating or treating
one in some particular way that had to be met. Mrs.
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
Bailey did not speculate. She knew, everything. Every
evening here would have a glory, but not the same kind of
glory. Reading would be more of a distraction than unpacking.
She read a few lines. They had a fresh attractive
<em>meaning</em>. Reading would be real. The dull adventures
of the Beagle looked real, coming along through reality.
She put the book on her knee and once more met the clear
brown shock of her room.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-5">

<p class="noindent">
The carpet is awful, faded and worn almost to bits.
But it is right, in this room.... This is the furnished
room; one room. I have come to it. &ldquo;You could get a
furnished room at about seven shillings rental.&rdquo; The awful
feeling, no tennis, no dancing, no house to move in, no
society. The relief at first when Bennett found those
people ... maddening endless roads of little houses in
the east wind ... their kind way of giving more than
they had undertaken, and smiling and waiting for smiles
and dying all the time in some dark way without knowing
it. Filling the rooms and the piano and the fern on the
serge table cloth and the broken soap dish in the bath
room until it was impossible to read or think or play because
of them, the feeling of them stronger and stronger till
there was nothing but crying over the trays of meals and
wanting to scream. The thought of the five turnings
to the station, all into long little roads looking alike and
making you forget which was which and lose your way,
was still full of pain ... the <em>relief</em> of moving to Granville
Place still a relief, though it felt a mistake from the first.
Mrs. Corrie&rsquo;s old teacher liking only certain sorts of people
knew it was a mistake, with her peevish silky old face and
her antique brooch. But it had been the beginning of
London.... Bond Street that Sunday morning in the
thick fog; these sudden pictures gleaming in a window,
filmy ... von Hier. Adelina Compayne, hanging out silk
stockings on the top balustrade. &ldquo;I <em>love</em> cawfy&rdquo; ... that
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
was the only real thing that had been said downstairs.
There was no need to have been frightened of these two
women in black silk evening dresses. None of these clever
things were real. They said young Asquith is a really able
man to hide their thoughts. The American Academy
pupils talked together to keep everybody off, except when
they made their clever jokes ... &ldquo;if anyone takes that
top bit there&rsquo;ll be murder Miss Spink.&rdquo; When they went
out of the room they looked silly. The young man was
real somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
The little man talking about the wonders of the linotype
in the smoking room.... How did I get into the smoking
room? Someone probably told Miss Spink I talked to him
in the smoking room and smoked a cigarette. Perhaps his
wife. If they could have seen. It was so surprising to hear
anybody suddenly talking. Perhaps he began in the hall
and ushered me into the smoking room. There was no one
there and I can&rsquo;t remember anything about the linotype,
only the quiet and the talking face and suddenly feeling
in the heart of London. But it was soon after that they
all began being stand-offish; before Mr. Chamberlayne
came; before Adela began playing Esther Summerson at
the Kennington. They approved of my going down to
fetch her until he began coming too. The shock of seeing
her clumsy heavy movements on the stage and her face
looking as though it were covered with starch.... I can
<em>think</em> about it all, here, and not mind.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-6">

<p class="noindent">
She <em>was</em> beautiful. It was happiness to sit and watch
her smoking so badly, in bed, in the strip of room, her
cloud of hair against the wall in the candlelight, two
o&rsquo;clock ... the Jesuit who had taught her chess ... and
Michael Somebody, the little book &ldquo;The Purple Pillar.&rdquo;
He was an <em>author</em> and he wanted to marry her and take her
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
back to Ireland. Perhaps by now she was back from America
and had gone, just out of kindness. She was strong and
beautiful and good, sitting up in her chemise, smoking....
I&rsquo;ve got that photograph of her as Marcia somewhere.
I must put it up. Miss Spink was surprised that last week,
the students getting me into their room ... the dark clean
shining piano, the azaleas and the muslin shaded lamp,
the way they all sat in their evening dresses, lounging and
stiff with stiff clean polished hair.... &ldquo;Miss Dust here&rsquo;s
going to be the highest soprano in the States.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;None
of that Miss Thicker.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;When she caught that top
note and the gold medal she went right up top, to stay
there, that minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was surprised when Mrs. Potter took me to hear
Melba. I heard Melba. I don&rsquo;t remember hearing her.
English opera houses are small; there are fine things all
over the world. If you see them all you can compare one
with the other; but then you don&rsquo;t see or hear anything
at all. It seems strange to be American and at the same
time stout and middle-aged. It would have got more and
more difficult with all those people. The dreadful way
the Americans got intimate and then talked or hinted
openly everywhere about intimate things. No one knew
how intimate Miss O&rsquo;Veagh was. I shall remember. There
is something about being Irish Roman Catholic that makes
<em>happiness</em>. She did not seem to think the George Street
room awful. She was <em>surprised</em> when I talked about the
hole in the wall and the cold and the imbecile servant and
the smell of ether. &ldquo;We are brought up from the first
to understand that we must never believe anything a man
says.&rdquo; She <em>came</em> and sat and talked and wrote after she had
gone ... &ldquo;goodbye&mdash;sweet blessed little rose of Mary&rdquo;
... she tried to make me think I was young and pretty.
She was sorry for me without saying so.
</p>

<p>
I should never have gone to Mornington Road unless I
had been nearly mad with sorrow ... if Miss Thomas
disapproved of germs and persons who let apartments why
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
did she come and take a room at George Street? She must
have seen she drove me nearly mad with sorrow. The
thought of Wales full of Welsh people like her, makes one
mad with sorrow.... Did she think I could get to know
her by hearing all her complaints? She&rsquo;s somewhere
now, sending someone mad.
</p>

<p>
I was mad already when I went to Mornington Road.

&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right with Mrs. Swanson&rdquo; ... the
awful fringes, the <em>horror</em> of the ugly clean little room,
the horror of Mrs. Swanson&rsquo;s heavy old body moving slowly
about the house, a heavy dark mountain, fringes, <a id="corr-3"></a>bulges,
slow dead eyes, slow dead voice, slow grimacing evil smile
... housekeeper to the Duke of Something and now moving
slowly about heavy with disapproval. She thought of me
as a business young lady.

Following advice is certain to be wrong. When you
don&rsquo;t follow advice there may be awful things. But they
are not arranged beforehand. And when they come you
do not know that they are awful until you have half got
hold of something else. Then they change into something
that has not been awful. Things that remain awful are in
some way not finished.... Those women are awful. They
will get more and more awful, still disliking and disapproving
till they die. I shall not see them again.... I will
never again be at the mercy of such women or at all in the
places where they are. That means keeping free of all
groups. In groups sooner or later one of them appears,
dead and sightless and bringing blindness and death ...
although they seem to like brightness and children and the
young people they approve of. I run away from them
because I must. They kill me. The thought of their death
is awful. Even in heaven no one could explain anything

people advise you to go there is in the end one of those
women....

When she turned out the gas the window spaces remained
faintly alight with a soft light like moonlight. At the
window she found a soft bluish radiance cast up from below
upon the opposite walls and windows. It went up into
the clear blue darkness of the sky.
</p>

<p>
When she lay down the bed smelt faintly of dust. The
air about her head under the sharply sloping ceiling was still
a little warm with the gas. It was full of her untrammelled
thoughts. Her luggage was lying about, quite near. She
thought of washing in the morning in the bright light on
the other side of the room ... leaves crowding all round
the lattice and here and there a pink rose ... <em>several pink
roses</em> ... the lovely air chilling the water ... the basin
quite up against the lattice ... dew splashing off the rose
bushes in the little garden almost dark with trellises and
trees, crowding with Harriett through the little damp
stiff gate, the sudden lineny smell of Harriett&rsquo;s pinafore
and the thought of Harriett in it, feeling the same, sudden
bright sunshine, two shouts, great cornfields going up and
up with a little track between them ... up over Blewburton
... <em>Whittenham Clumps</em>. Before I saw Whittenham
Clumps I had always known them. But we saw them
before we knew they were called Whittenham Clumps. It
was a surprise to know anybody who had seen them and
that they had a name.

St. Pancras bells were clamouring in the room; rapid
scales, beginning at the top, coming with a loud full thump
on to the fourth note and finishing with a rush to the
lowest which was hardly touched before the top note hung
again in the air, sounding outdoors clean and clear while
all the other notes still jangled together in her room.
Nothing had changed. The night was like a moment added
to the day; like years going backwards to the beginning;
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
and in the brilliant sunshine the unchanging things began
again, perfectly new. She leaped out of bed into the
clamorous stillness and stood in the window rolling up the
warm hair that felt like a shawl round her shoulders. A
cup of tea and then the &rsquo;bus to Harriett&rsquo;s. A &rsquo;bus somewhere
just out there beyond the morning stillness of the
street. What an <em>adventure</em> to go out and take a &rsquo;bus without
having to face anybody. They were all out there,
away somewhere, the very thought and sight of them, disapproving
and deploring her surroundings. She listened.
There they were. There were their very voices, coming
plaintive and reproachful with a held-in indignation,
intonations that she knew inside and out, coming on bells
from somewhere beyond the squares&mdash;another church.
She withdrew the coloured cover and set her spirit lamp
on the inkstained table. Strong bright light was standing
outside the window. The clamour of the bells had ceased.
From far away down in the street a loud hoarse voice came
thinly up. Referee&mdash;Lloyd&rsquo;s&mdash;Sunday Times&mdash;People&mdash;<em>pypa</em>....
A front door opened with a loud crackle of
paint. The voice dropped to speaking tones that echoed
clearly down the street and came up clear and soft and
confidential. Referee? Lloyd&rsquo;s? The door closed with
a large firm wooden sound and the harsh voice went on down
the street.
</p>

<p>
St. Pancras bells burst forth again. Faintly interwoven
with their bright headlong scale were the clear sweet
delicate contralto of the more distant bells playing very
swiftly and reproachfully a five finger exercise in a minor
key. That must be a very high-Anglican church; with
light coming through painted windows on to carvings and
decorations.

<p class="noindent">
As she began on her solid slice of bread and butter St.
Pancras bells stopped again. In the stillness she could hear
the sound of her own munching. She stared at the surface
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
of the table that held her plate and cup. It was like sitting
up to the nursery table. &ldquo;How frightfully happy I am,&rdquo;
she thought with bent head. Happiness streamed along
her arms and from her head. St. Pancras bells began
playing a hymn tune in single firm beats with intervals
between that left each note standing for a moment gently
in the air. The first two lines were playing carefully through
to the distant accompaniment of the rapid weaving and
interweaving in a regular unbroken pattern of the five
soft low contralto bells. The third line of the hymn ran
through Miriam&rsquo;s head a ding-dong to and fro from tone
to semitone. The bells played it out, without the semitone,
with a perfect satisfying falsity. Miriam sat hunched against
the table listening for the ascending stages of the last line.
The bells climbed gently up, made a faint flat dab at the
last top note, left it in the air askew above the decorous
little tune and rushed away down their scale as if to cover
the impropriety. They clamoured recklessly mingling with
Miriam&rsquo;s shout of joy as they banged against the wooden
walls of the window space.

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar"><span class="prefirstchar">&ldquo;</span>B</span><span class="postfirstchar">een</span> to church?&rdquo; said Gerald digging his shoulders
into his chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. Have you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not been for weeks.... Everybody thinks us
awful heathens.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Curls. She says she&rsquo;s hanged if she&rsquo;s going any
more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand the vicar&rdquo; said Harriett. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
believe a word he says.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fancy Harriett!...
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Besides, what&rsquo;s the good?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with church once in a way
to my way of thinking if it&rsquo;s a decent high musical service.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even Eve hardly ever goes now&mdash;and nobody could
possibly be more goody than she is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was disquieting. It was one thing to be the agnostic
of the family&mdash;but Eve and Harriett. Miriam pondered
resentfully while Gerald smoked and flicked his clothing
and Harriett sat upright and pursed and untroubled in her
great chair. She wondered whether she ought to say something
about Unitarianism. But after all there might not
be anything in it and they might not feel the relief of the
way it cleared up the trouble about Christ. Besides there
was no worry here in the room. A discussion would lead
nowhere. They could all three look at each other if they
wanted to and laugh everything off. In the middle of a
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
sleepy Sunday afternoon with nothing to do sitting in three
huge chairs and looking at each other they were all right.
Harriett&rsquo;s strength and scorn were directed against everything
in the world but not against herself ... never against herself.
Harriett often thought her grumpy and ill-tempered,
but she approved of her. She was approving now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all Frills it&rsquo;s good form to go&rdquo; Gerald said idly.
&ldquo;Go on. Smart people go to show their clothes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve shown ours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Harriett flew out of her chair and daintily kicked him.
</p>

<p>
He grabbed and missed and sank back wailing, his face
hidden in a cushion. Her dainty foot flew out once more
and he smothered a shriek.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shut up&rdquo; said Harriett curling herself up in her chair.
</p>

<p>
Gerald wailed on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do we smoke in here?&rdquo; said Miriam, wanting the
scene to drop or change while it was perfect. She would
tell them now about her change of lodgings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Harriett absently with an eye on Gerald.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my diggings&rdquo; began Miriam formally,
fumbling for her packet of cigarettes. Harriett was hurling
a cushion. Gerald crumpled into the depths of his chair
and sobbed aloud, beating with his arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop it silly&rdquo; piped Harriett blushing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my diggings&rdquo; repeated Miriam uncomfortably.
Harriett&rsquo;s face flashed a response. Gerald&rsquo;s loud
wailings were broken by beseeching cries. Real, absolutely
real and satisfying. Miriam answered them from some
far deep in herself as if they were her own cries. Harry was
embarrassed. Her bright strength was answering. She was
ashamed at being seen answering.
</p>

<p>
Miriam got up conversationally and began looking about
for matches in the soft curtained drawing-room light.
There were swift movements and Harriett&rsquo;s voice busily
chiding. When she turned Gerald was sitting on the floor
at Harriett&rsquo;s knee beating it gently with his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Got a match, G?&rdquo; she said seeing in imagination the
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
flare of the match in the soft greenish glare of the room.
There was bright light all round the house and a glare of
brightness in the garden, beyond the curtains. &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo;
said Gerald, &ldquo;dozens.&rdquo; He sat up and handed out a box.
Leaning back against Harriett&rsquo;s knee he began intoning a
little poem of appeal. There was a ring at the front door
bell. Miriam got herself to the piano putting cigarettes
and matches behind a vase on the mantelshelf. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
old Tremayne&rdquo; said Gerald cheerfully, shooting his linen
and glancing in the strip of mirror in the overmantel. The
door opened admitting the light from the hall. The
curtains at the open French windows swayed forward
flooding the room with the bright garden light. Into the
brightness stepped Mr. Tremayne, grey-clad and with a
pink rose in his buttonhole.
</p>

<p>
Over tea they heard the story of his morning and how
it had been interrupted by the man on the floor above
who had come down in his dressing gown to tell him about
a birthday party ... the two men sitting telling each
other stories about drinks and people seeing each other
home. After tea he settled back easily in his chair and
went on with his stories. Miriam found it almost impossible
to follow him. She grew weary of his bantering tone.
It smeared over everything he touched and made him appear
to be saying one thing over and over again in innuendo.
Something he could not say out and would never get away
from. He made little pauses and then it gleamed horribly
about all his refinement of dress and bearing and Gerald
laughed encouragingly and he went on, making a story
that was like a play, that looked like life did when you looked
at it, a maddening fussiness about nothing and people getting
into states of mind. He went on into a story about business
life ... people getting the better of each other. It made
her feel sick with apprehension. Anybody in business might
be ruined any minute unless he could be sure of getting
the better of someone else. She had never realised that
before.... It pressed on her breathing and made her feel
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
that she had had too much tea.... She hated the exponent
sitting there so coolly. It made the cool green-lit afternoon
room an island amongst horrors. But it was that to
him too ... he felt the need of something beyond the
everlasting innuendo of social life and the everlasting smartness
of business life. She felt it was true that he spent
Sunday mornings picking out hymn tunes with one finger
and liked &ldquo;Sabbath music&rdquo; and remembered the things
his mother used to play to him. He wanted a home, something
away from business life and away from social life.
He saw her as a woman in a home, nicely dressed in a quiet
drawing room, lit by softly screened clear fresh garden
daylight.... &ldquo;Business is business.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;Man&rsquo;s love is
of man&rsquo;s life a thing apart&mdash;&rsquo;tis woman&rsquo;s whole existence.&rdquo;
Tennyson did not know what he was saying when he wrote
it in his calm patronising way. Mr. Tremayne would
admire it as a &ldquo;great truth&rdquo;&mdash;thinking it like a man in the
way Tennyson thought it. What a hopeless thing a man&rsquo;s
consciousness was. How awful to have nothing but a man&rsquo;s
consciousness. One could test it so easily if one were a
little careful, and know exactly how it would behave....
</p>

<p>
Opening a volume of Mendelssohn she played from his
point of view one of the Songs without Words quietly
into the conversation. The room grew still. She felt
herself and Mr. Tremayne as duplicates of Harriett and
Gerald only that she was a very religious very womanly
woman, the ideal wife and mother and he was a bad fast
man who wanted to be saved. It was such an easy part
to play. She could go on playing it to the end of her life,
if he went on in business and made enough money, being a
&ldquo;gracious silence,&rdquo; taking an interest in his affairs, ordering
all things well, quietly training the servants, never losing
her temper or raising her voice, making the home a sanctuary
of rest and refreshment and religious aspiration, going to
church.... She felt all these things expressing themselves
in her bearing. At the end of her piece she was touched
to the heart by the look of adoration in his eyes, the
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
innocent youthfulness shining through his face. There
was something in him she could have and guard and keep
if she chose. Something that would die if there were no
woman to keep it there. There was nothing in his life of
business and music halls to keep it there, nothing but the
memory of his mother and he joined her on to that memory.
His mother and his wife were sacred ... apart from life.
But he could not be really happy with a woman unless he
could also despise her. Any interest in generalities, any
argument or criticism or opposition would turn him into
a towering bully. All men were like that in some way.
They each had a set of notions and fought with each other
about them whenever they were together and not eating
or drinking. If a woman opposed them they went mad.
He would like one or two more Mendelssohns and then
supper. And if she kept out of the conversation and
listened and smiled a little he would go away adoring.
She played the Duetto; the chords made her think of
Beethoven and play the last page carelessly and glance at
Harriett. Harriett had felt her response to the chords
and knew she was getting away from Mendelssohn. Mr.
Tremayne had moved to a chair quite close to the piano,
just behind her. She found the Beethoven and played
the first movement of a sonata. It leapt about the piano
breaking up her pose, using her body as the instrument of
its gay wild shapeliness, spreading her arms inelegantly,
swaying her, lifting her from the stool with the crash and
vibration of its chords.... &ldquo;Go on&rdquo; said Harriett when
it came to an end. The Largo came with a single voice deep
and broad and quiet; the great truth behind the fuss of
things. She felt her hearers grow weary of its reiterations
and dashed on alone recklessly into the storm of the last
movement. Through its tuneless raging she could hear
the steady voice and see the steady shining of the broad
clear light. Daylight and gaiety and night and storm and
a great song and truth, the great truth that was bigger
than anything. Beethoven. She got up, charged to the
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
fingertips with a glow that transfigured all the inanimate
things in the room. The party was wrecked ... a young
lady who banged the piano till her hair nearly came down....
Mr. Tremayne had heard nothing but noise....
His eyes smiled and his uneasy mouth felt for compliments.

When they sat down to play halfpenny nap after supper
Miriam recovered her cigarette from its hiding place. She
did not know the game. She sat at Harriett&rsquo;s new card-table
wrapped in the unbroken jesting of the Bollingdons
and the Ducaynes, happily learning and smoking and feeling
happily wicked. The Bollingdons taught her simply with
a complete trustful friendliness, Mrs. Bollingdon leaning
across in her pink satin blouse, her clear clean bulging
cheeks and dark velvet hair like a full blown dark rose.
Between the rounds they poured out anecdotes of earlier
nap parties, all talking at once. The pauses at the fresh
beginnings were full of the echoes of their laughter. Miriam
in the character of the Honourable Miss Henderson had
just accepted Lord Bollingdon&rsquo;s invitation to join the
Duke and Duchess of Ducayne and himself and Lady
Bollingdon in an all-day party to Wembley Park in a break
and four on Easter Monday and had lit a second cigarette
and accepted a small whisky and soda when Mr. Grove was
announced. Harriett&rsquo;s face flushed jocular consternation.
</p>

<p>
When the party subsided after Mr. Grove&rsquo;s spasmodic
handshakings Miriam got herself into a chair in a far
corner, smoking her cigarette with burning cheeks. Sitting
isolated with her cigarette and her whisky while he twice
sent his low harsh clearly murmuring voice into the suddenly
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
empty air to say that he had been to evensong at the
Carmelites and was on his way home, she examined the relief
of his presence and the nature of her farewell. Mr. Bollingdon
responded to him remarking each time on the
splendour of the evening.

Strolling home towards midnight along the narrow pavement
of Endsleigh Gardens Miriam felt as fresh and untroubled
as if it were early morning. When she had got
out of her Hammersmith omnibus into the Tottenham
Court Road she had found that the street had lost its first
terrifying impression and had become part of her home.
It was the borderland of the part of London she had
found for herself; the part where she was going to live,
in freedom, hidden, on her pound a week. It was all she
wanted. That was why she was young and glad; that
was why fatigue had gone out of her life. There was
nothing in the world that could come nearer to her than
the curious half twilight half moonlight effect of lamplit
Endsleigh Gardens opening out of Gower Place; its huge
high trees, their sharp shadows on the little pavement
running by the side of the railings, the neighbouring gloom
of the Euston Road dimly lit by lamps standing high in
the middle of the roadway at long intervals, the great high
quiet porched houses, black and still, the shadow mass of
St. Pancras church, the great dark open space in front of
the church, a shadowy figure-haunted darkness with the
vague stream of the Euston Road running to one side of
it and the corridor of Woburn Place opening on the other.
The harsh voice of an invisible woman sounded out from
it as she turned off into her own street.... &ldquo;Dressed
up&mdash;he was&mdash;to the bloody death.&rdquo; ... The words echoed
about her as she strolled down the street controlling her
impulse to flinch and hurry. The woman was there, there
and real and that was what she had said. Resentment was
lurking about the street. The woman&rsquo;s harsh voice seemed
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
close. Miriam pictured her glaring eyes. There was no
pretence about her. She felt what she said. She belonged
to the darkness about St. Pancras church ... people had
been garrotted in that part of the Euston Road not so
very long ago.... Tansley Street was a soft grey gloaming
after the darkness. When she rattled her key into the
keyhole of number seven she felt that her day was beginning.
It would be perpetually beginning now. Nights and days
were all one day; all hers, unlimited. Her life and work
at Wimpole Street were something extra, thrown in with
her own life of endless day. Sarah and Harriett, their
lives and friends, her own friends, the Brooms, the girls
in Kennett Street, all thrown in. She lit her table lamp
and the gas and two candles, making her little brown
room brilliant under a brilliant white ceiling and sat down
eager to tell someone of her wealth and freedom.

Walking home along the Upper Richmond Road; not
liking to buy sweets; not enjoying anything to the full&mdash;always
afraid of her refinements; always in a way wanting
to be like her; wanting to share her mysterious knowledge
of how things were done in the world and the things one
had to do to get on in some clever world where people
were doing things. Never really wanting it because the
mere thought of that would take the beauty of the syringa
and make it look sad. Never being able to explain why
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
one did not want to do reasonable clever things in a clever
brisk reasonable way; why one disliked the way she went
behaving up and down the Upper Richmond Road with
her pretty neat brisk bustling sidling walk, keeping her
secret with a sort of prickly brightness. The Upper Richmond
Road was heaven, pure heaven; smelling of syringa.
She liked flowers but she did not seem to know....
<em>Syringa.</em> I had forgotten. That is one of the things I have
always wanted to stop and remember.... What was it
all about? What was she doing now? Anyhow the London
post-card would be an answer. A letter, making her see
Germany and bits of Newlands and what life was now
would answer everything, all her snubs and cleverness and
bring back the Upper Richmond Road and make it beautiful.
She will know something of what it was to me then. Perhaps
that was why she liked me even though she thought me
vulgar and very lazy and stupid.

after late nights, managing to keep nine o&rsquo;clock
appointments&mdash;in a north wind. Miriam pressed the bell
urgently. The scrubbed chalky mosaic and the busy bright
brass plate reproached her for her lateness during the long
moment before the door was opened.... It must be
someone for Mr. Orly; an appointment made since last
night; that was the worst of his living in the house. He
was in his surgery now, with the patient. The nine-fifteen
patient would come almost at once. He would discover
that his charts were not out before there was any chance
of getting at his appointment book.... As the great door
swung open she saw Mr. Hancock turn the corner of the
street walking very rapidly before the north wind....
Mr. Orly&rsquo;s voice was sounding impatiently from the back
of the hall.... &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Miss Hends.... Oh&mdash;here
y&rsquo;are Miss Hends, I say call up Chalk for me will ya, get
him to come at once, I&rsquo;ve got the patient waiting.&rdquo; His
huge frock-coated form swung round into his surgery without
waiting for an answer. Miriam scurried through the hall
past Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s open surgery door and into her room. Mr.
Leyton plunged out of his room as she was flinging down her
things and came in briskly. &ldquo;Morning, Pater got a gas case?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mm&rdquo;; said Miriam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to call up Chalk
and I haven&rsquo;t a second to do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why Chalk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know. He said Chalk&rdquo; said Miriam angrily,
seizing the directory.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call him up if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a saint. Tell him to come at once&mdash;sooner,&rdquo;
said Miriam dabbing at her hair as she ran back through
the hall and upstairs. As she passed the turn of the staircase
Mr. Hancock was let in at the front door. She found
his kettle furiously boiling on its wrought-iron stand near
the chair. The stained glass window just behind it was
dim with steam. She lowered the gas, put a tumbler in
the socket of the spittoon, lit the gas burner on the bracket
table and swiftly pulled open its drawers one by one. The
instruments were all right ... the bottles&mdash;no chloroform,
the carbolic bottle nearly empty and its label soaked
and defaced. Gathering the two bottles in her hand she
turned to the instrument cabinet, no serviettes, no rubber
dam, clamps not up from the workshop. The top of the
cabinet still to be dusted. Dust and scraps of amalgam
were visible about the surfaces of the paper lining the
instrument drawers. No saliva tubes in the basin. She
swung round to the bureau and hurriedly read through
the names of the morning&rsquo;s patients. Mr. Hancock came
quietly in as she was dusting the top of the instrument
cabinet by pushing the boxes and bottles of materials that
littered its surface to the backmost edge. They were all
lightly coated with dust. It was everlasting and the long
tubes and metal body of the little furnace were dull again.
&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; they said simultaneously, in even tones.
There were sounds of letters being opened and the turning
of the pages of the appointment book. The chain of Mr.
Hancock&rsquo;s gold pencil case rattled softly as he made notes
on the corners of the letters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you have a pleasant week-end?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very&rdquo; said Miriam emphatically.
</p>

<p>
There was a squeak at the side of the cabinet. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
said Miriam down the speaking tube.... &ldquo;Thank you.
Will you please bring up some tubes and serviettes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Wontner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;Mrs. Hermann is &lsquo;frightfully
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
shocked&rsquo; at the amount of her account. What did we send
it in for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seventy guineas. It&rsquo;s a reduction, and it&rsquo;s two years&rsquo;
work for the whole family.&rdquo; The bell sounded again....
&ldquo;Lady Cazalet has bad toothache and can you see her
at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Con<em>found</em>.... Will you go down and talk to her and
see if you can get one of the others to see her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well then she must wait. I&rsquo;ll have Mr. Wontner up.&rdquo;
Miriam rang. Mr. Hancock began busily washing his
hands. The patient came in. He greeted him over his
shoulder. Miriam gathered up the sheaf of annotated
letters and the appointment book and ran down-stairs.
&ldquo;Has Mr. Leyton a patient Emma?&rdquo; &ldquo;Miss Jones just
gone in, Miss.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Emma, will you ask the workshop
for Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s rubber and clamps?&rdquo; She rang through
to Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a patient of Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s
in pain, can you see them if I can persuade them?&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;Right, in ten minutes&rdquo; came the answering
murmur. Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s bell sounded from her room.
She went to his tube in the hall. &ldquo;Can I have my charts?&rdquo;
Running into her room she hunted out the first chart from
a case full and ran upstairs with it. Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s patient
was sitting forward in the chair urging the adoption of the
decimal system. Running down again she went into the
waiting room. The dark Turkey carpeted oak furnished
length seemed full of seated forms. Miriam peered and
Lady Cazalet, with her hat already off rose from the deep
arm-chair at her side. &ldquo;Can he see me?&rdquo; she said in a
clear trembling undertone, her dark eyes wide upon
Miriam&rsquo;s. Miriam gazed deep into the limpid fear. What
a privilege. How often Captain Cazalet must be beside
himself with unworthiness. &ldquo;Yes, if you can wait a little&rdquo;
she said dropping her eyes and standing with arms restrained.
&ldquo;I think it won&rsquo;t be very long&rdquo; she added lingering a
moment as the little form relapsed into the chair.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
&ldquo;Lady Cazalet will wait until you can see her&rdquo; she
tubed up to Mr. Hancock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make her see one of the others?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s impossible; I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll see her as soon as I can. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll
have to wait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam went back to her room to sort out the remaining
charts. On her table lay a broken denture in a faded morocco
case; a strip of paper directed &ldquo;five-thirty sharp&rdquo; in Mr.
Orly&rsquo;s handwriting. Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s door burst open. He
came with flying coat-tails.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Vi got to see that patient of Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s&rdquo; he asked
breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&rdquo; said Miriam &ldquo;she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right&rdquo; he said swinging back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep Miss Jones
on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s bell sounded again. Miriam flew to the
tube.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My clamps please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes&rdquo; she answered shocked, and hurried back to
her room.
</p>

<p>
Gathering up the broken denture she ran down the stone
steps leading to the basement. Her cheap unyielding shoes
clattered on the unyielding stones. The gas was on in the
lunch room, Mrs. Willis scrubbing the floor. The voices
of the servants came from the kitchens in the unknown
background. She passed the lunch room and the cellar
and clamped on across the stone hall to the open door of
the workshop.

<p class="noindent">
Winthrop was standing at the small furnace in the box-lined
passage way. It was roaring its loudest. Through
its open door the red light fell sharply on his pink-flushed
face and drooping fair moustache and poured down over
his white apron. &ldquo;Good ph-morning&rdquo; he said pleasantly,
his eye on the heart of the furnace, his foot briskly pumping
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
the blower. From the body of the room came sounds
of tapping and whistling ... the noise of the furnace
prevented their knowing that anyone had come in....
Miriam drew near to the furnace, relieved at the shortness
of her excursion. She stared at the tiny shape blazing
red-gold at the heart of the glare. Winthrop gathered up
a pair of tongs and drew the mould from the little square
of light. The air hissed from the bellows and the roaring
of the flames died down. In a moment he was standing
free with hot face and hot patient ironic eyes, gently taking
the denture from her hands. &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; said
Miriam, &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Winthrop, it&rsquo;s a repair for Mr. Orly.
It&rsquo;s urgent. Can you manage it?&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ph&mdash;ph&mdash;sure
to be urgent&rdquo; said Winthrop examining the denture with
a short-sighted frown. Miriam waited anxiously. The
hammering and whistling had ceased. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right,
Miss Ph-Henderson&rdquo; said Winthrop encouragingly. She
turned to the door. The clamps.... Gathering herself
together she went down the passage and stood at the
head of the two stone steps leading down into the body of
the room. A swift scrubbing of emery paper on metal
was going on at the end of the long bench, lit by a long
sky-light, from which the four faces looked up at her with
a chorus of good mornings in response to her greeting.
&ldquo;Are Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s clamps ready?&rdquo; she asked diffidently.
&ldquo;Jimmy ...&rdquo; The figure nearest to her glanced down the
row of seated forms. The small bullet-headed boy at the
end of the bench scrubbed vigorously and ironically with
his emery stick. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be a minute, Miss Henderson&rdquo;
said the near pupil comfortingly.
</p>

<p>
Miriam observed his spruce grey suit curiously masked
by the mechanic&rsquo;s apron, the quiet controlled amused face,
and felt the burden of her little attack as part of the patient
prolonged boredom of his pupillage. The second pupil,
sitting next to him kept dog-like sympathetic eyes on her
face, waiting for a glance. She passed him by, smiling
gently in response without looking at him while her eyes
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
rested upon the form of the junior mechanic whose head
was turned in the direction of the scrubbing boy. The
head was refined, thin and clear cut, thatched with glossy
curls. Its expression was servile&mdash;the brain eagerly seeking
some flowery phrase&mdash;something to decorate at once the
occasion and the speaker, and to give relief to the mouth
strained in an arrested obsequious smile. Nothing came
and the clever meticulous hands were idle on the board.
It seemed absurd to say that Mr. Hancock was waiting for
the clamps while Jimmy was scrubbing so busily. But they
had obviously been forgotten. She fidgeted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will somebody send them up when they&rsquo;re done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jimmy, you&rsquo;re a miserable sinner, hurry up&rdquo; said the
senior pupil.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re done&rdquo; said Jimmy in a cracked bass voice.
&ldquo;Thank goodness&rdquo; breathed Miriam, dimpling. Jimmy
came round and scattered the clamps carefully into her
outstretched hand, with down-cast eyes and a crisp dimpling
smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rule Bri<em>tan</em>nia,&rdquo; remarked the junior pupil, resuming
his work as Miriam turned away and hurried along the
passage and through the door held open for her by Winthrop.
She flew up to Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s room three steps at a time,
tapped gently at the door and went in. He came forward
across the soft grey green carpet to take the clamps and
murmured gently &ldquo;Have you got my carbolic?&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-3-3">

<p class="noindent">
Miriam looked out the remainder of the charts and went
anxiously through the little pile of letters she had brought
down from Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s room. All but three were
straight-forward appointments to be sent. One bore besides
the pencilled day and date the word &ldquo;Tape&rdquo; ... she
glanced through it&mdash;it was from a University settlement
worker, asking for an appointment for the filling of two
front teeth.... She would understand increasing by one
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
thickness per day until there were five, to be completed
two days before the appointment falls due so that any
tenderness may have passed off. Mrs. Hermann&rsquo;s letter
bore no mark. She could make a rough summary in Mr.
Hancock&rsquo;s phraseology. The third letter enclosed a printed
card of appointment with Mr. Hancock which she had sent
without filling in the day and hour. She flushed. Mr.
Hancock had pencilled in the missing words. Gathering
the letters together she put them as far away as her hand
would reach, leaving a space of shabby ink-stained morocco
clear under her hands. She looked blindly out of the
window; hand-painted, they are hand-painted, forget-me-nots
and gold tendrils softly painted, not shining, on an
unusual shape, a merry Christmas. Melly Klismas. In
this countree heapee lain, chiney man lun home again,
under a red and green paper umbrella in the pouring rain,
that was not a hand-painted one, but better, in some <em>strange</em>
way, close bright colours drawing everything <em>in</em>; a shock.
I stayed in there. There was something. Chinee man
lun <em>home</em> again. Her eye roamed over the table; everything
but the newly-arrived letters shabby under the high
wide uncurtained window. The table fitted the width
of the window. There was something to be done before
anything could be done. Everything would look different
if something were done. The fresh letters could lie neatly
on the centre of the table in the midst of something. They
were on the address books, spoiled by them. It would take
years to check the addresses one by one till the old books could
be put away. If the day books were entered up to date,
there would still be those, disfiguring everything. If everything
were absolutely up to date, and all the cupboards in
perfect order and the discounts and decimals always done
in the depot-books to time there would be time to do
something. She replaced the letters in the centre of the
table and put them back again on the address books. His
nine-forty-five patient was being let in at the front door.
In a moment his bell would ring and something must be
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
said about the appointment card. &ldquo;Mr. Orly?&rdquo; A big
booming elderly voice, going on heavily murmuring into
the waiting-room. She listened tensely to the movements
of the servant. Was Mr. Orly in &ldquo;the den&rdquo; or in his
surgery? She heard the maid ring through to the surgery
and wait. No sound. The maid came through her room
and tapped at the door leading from it. <em>Come</em> in sang a
voice from within and Miriam heard the sound of a hammer
on metal as the maid opened the door. She flew to the
surgery. Amidst the stillness of heavy oak furniture and
dark Turkey carpet floated the confirming smell. There
it was all about the spittoon and the red velvet covered
chair and the bracket table, a horrible confusion&mdash;and blood
stains, blood blotted serviettes, forceps that made her feel
sick and faint. Summoning up her strength she gathered
up the serviettes and flung them into a basket behind the
instrument cabinet. She was dabbing at the stains on the
American cloth cover of the bracket when Mr. Orly came
swinging in, putting on his grey frock-coat and humming
Gunga Din as he came. &ldquo;Regular field day&rdquo; he said cheerfully.
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t want those things&mdash;just pop &rsquo;em out of
sight.&rdquo; He turned up the cupboard gas and in a moment
a stream of boiling water hissed down into the basin filling
the room with steam. &ldquo;I say, has this man got a chart?
Don&rsquo;t throw away those teeth. Just look at this&mdash;how&rsquo;s
that for twisted? Just look here.&rdquo; He took up an object
to which Miriam forced reluctant eyes, grotesquely formed
fangs protruding from the enclosing blades of a huge
forceps. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that eh?&rdquo; Miriam made a sympathetic
sound. Gathering the many forceps he detached their
contents putting the relic into a bottle of spirit and the
rest into the hidden basket. The forceps went head first
into a jar of carbolic and Miriam breathed more freely.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to those. I say has this man got a chart?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see&rdquo; said Miriam eagerly making off with the appointment
book. She returned with the chart. Mr. Orly hummed
and looked. &ldquo;Right. Tell &rsquo;em to send him in. I say,
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
vi got any gold and tin?&rdquo; Miriam consulted the box in
a drawer in the cabinet. It was empty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you
haven&rsquo;t&rdquo; she said guiltily. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll let y&rsquo;know.
Send &rsquo;im in,&rdquo; and he resumed Gunga Din over the wash-hand
basin. Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s bell was ringing in her room
and she hurried off with a sign to the little maid waiting
with raised eyebrows in the hall. Darting into her room
she took the foils from the safe, laid them on a clean
serviette amongst the litter on her table and ran upstairs.
Mr. Leyton opened his door as she passed &ldquo;I say, can you
feed for me&rdquo; he asked breathlessly, putting out an anxious
head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come down in a minute&rdquo; promised Miriam
from the stairs. Mr. Hancock was drying his hands. He
sounded his bell as she came in. The maid answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry&rdquo; began Miriam. &ldquo;Show up Mr. Green&rdquo;
said Mr. Hancock down the speaking tube. &ldquo;You remember
there&rsquo;s Lady Cazalet?&rdquo; said Miriam relieved and feeling
she was making good her carelessness in the matter of the
appointment card.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh con<em>found</em>.&rdquo; He rang again hurriedly. &ldquo;Show up
Lady Cazalet.&rdquo; Miriam swept from the bracket table
the litter of used instruments and materials, disposing them
rapidly on the cabinet, into the sterilising tray, the waste
basket and the wash-hand basin, tore the uppermost leaf
from the headrest pad, and detached the handpiece from the
arm of the motor drill while the patient was being shown
upstairs. Mr. Hancock had cleared the spittoon, set a fresh
tumbler, filled the kettle and whisked the debris of amalgam
and cement from the bracket table before he began the
scrubbing and cleansing of his hands, and when the patient
came in Miriam was in her corner reluctantly handling the
instruments, wet with the solution that crinkled her fingertips
and made her skin brittle and dry. Everything was in
its worst state. The business of drying and cleansing, freeing
fine points from minute closely adhering fragments,
polishing instruments on the leather pad, repolishing them
with the leather, scraping the many little burs with the
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
fine wire brush, scraping the clamps, clearing the obstinate
amalgam from slab and spatula, brought across her the ever-recurring
circle. The things were begun, they were getting
on, she had half-done ... the exasperating tediousness
of holding herself to the long series of tiny careful attention-demanding
movements ... the punctual emergence
when the end was in sight of the hovering reflection,
nagging and questioning, that another set of things was
already getting ready for another cleansing process; the
endless series to last as long as she stayed at Wimpole
Street ... were there any sort of people who could do this
kind of thing patiently, without minding? ... the evolution
of dentistry was wonderful, but the more perfect
it became the more and more of this sort of thing there
would be ... the more drudgery workers, at fixed salaries
... it was only possible for people who were fine and nice
... there must be, everywhere, women doing this work
for people who were not nice. They <em>could</em> not do it for
the work&rsquo;s sake. Did some of them do it cheerfully, as
unto God. It was wrong to work unto man. But could
God approve of this kind of thing ... was it right to spend
life cleaning instruments ... the blank moment again
of gazing about in vain for an alternative ... all work
has drudgery. That is not the answer.... Blessèd be
Drudgery, but that was housekeeping, not someone else&rsquo;s
drudgery.... As she put the things back in the drawers,
every drawer offered tasks of tidying, replenishing, and
repapering of small boxes and grooves and sections. She
had remembered to bring up Lady Cazalet&rsquo;s chart. It
looked at her propped against the small furnace. Behind
it were the other charts for the day complete. The drug
bottles were full, there was plenty of amadou pulled soft
and cut ready for use, a fair supply of both kinds of Japanese
paper. None of the bottles and boxes of stopping materials
were anywhere near running short and the gold drawer
was filled. She examined the drawers that held the less
frequently used fittings and materials, conducting her
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
operations noiselessly without impeding Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s
perpetual movements to and fro between the chair and the
instrument cabinet. Meanwhile the dressing of Lady
Cazalet&rsquo;s painful tooth went quietly on and Mr. Leyton
was waiting, hoping for her assistance downstairs. There
was no excuse for waiting upstairs any longer. She went
to the writing table and hung over the appointment book.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-3-4">

<p class="noindent">
It was a busy day. He would hardly have half an hour
for lunch.... She examined the names carefully, one
by one, and wrote against one &ldquo;ask address,&rdquo; underlined
and against another &ldquo;enquire for brother&mdash;ill.&rdquo; Lady
Cazalet drew a deep sigh ... she had been to other
dentists. But perhaps they were good ones. Perhaps she
was about thirty ... had she ever gone through a green
baize door and seen a fat common little man with smooth
sly eyes standing waiting for her in a dark stuffy room
smelling of creosote? Even if she had always been to good
ones they were not Mr. Hancock. They were dentists.
Cheerful ordinary men with ordinary voices and laughs,
thinking about all manner of things. Or apparently bland,
with ingratiating manners. Perhaps a few of them, some
of his friends and some of the young men he had trained
were something like him. Interested in dentistry and the
way it was all developing, some of them more enthusiastic
and interested in certain special things than he was. But
no one could be quite like him. No other patients had the
lot of his patients. No other dentist was so completely
conscious of the patient all the time, as if he were in the chair
himself. No other dentist went on year after year remaining
sensitive to everything the patient had to endure. No
one else was so unsparing of himself ... children coming
eagerly in for their dentistry, sitting in the chair with slack
limbs and wide open mouths and tranquil eyes ... small
bodies braced and tense, fat hands splayed out tightly on
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
the too-big arms of the chair in determination to bear the
moment of pain bravely for him.... She wandered to
the corner cupboard and opened it and gazed idly in. But
none of them knew what it cost.... &ldquo;I think you won&rsquo;t
have any more pain with that; I&rsquo;ll just put in a dressing
for the present&rdquo;&mdash;she was Lady Cazalet again, without
tooth-ache, and that awful feeling that you know your
body won&rsquo;t last ... they did not know what it cost. What
always doing the best for the patient <em>meant</em>. Perhaps they
knew in a way; or knew something and did not know
what it was ... there would be something different in Mr.
Hancock&rsquo;s expression, especially in the three quarters view
when his face was turned away towards the instrument
cabinet, if he saved his nerves and energy and money by
doing things less considerately, not perpetually having the
instruments sharpened and perpetually buying fresh outfits
of sharp burs. The patient would suffer more pain
... a dentist at his best ought to be more delicately strong
and fine than a doctor ... like a fine engraving ... a surgeon
working amongst live nerves ... and he would look different
himself. It was in him. It was keeping to that, all day,
and every day, choosing the best difficult tiresome way in
everything that kept that radiance about him when he was
quietly at work ... I mustn&rsquo;t stay here thinking these
thoughts ... it&rsquo;s that evil thing in me, keeping on and on,
always thinking thoughts, nothing getting done ... going
through life like&mdash;a stuck pig. If I went straight on things
would come like that just the same in flashes&mdash;bang, bang,
in your heart, everything breaking into light just in front
of you, making you almost fall off the edge into the expanse
coming up before you, flowers and light stretching out.
Then you shut it down, letting it go through you with a
leap that carries you to the moon&mdash;the sun, and makes you
bump with life like the little boy bursting out of his too
small clothes and go on choking with song to do the next
thing deftly. That&rsquo;s right. Perhaps that is what they all
<em>do</em>? Perhaps that&rsquo;s why they won&rsquo;t stop to remember.
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
Do you realise? Do you realise you&rsquo;re in Brussels? Just
<em>look</em> at the white houses there with the bright green trees
against them in the light. It&rsquo;s the <em>air</em>, the clearness. Sh&mdash;If
they hear you, they&rsquo;ll put up the rent. They were just
Portsmouth and Gosport people, staying in Brussels and
fussing about Portsmouth and Gosport and Aunt this and
Mr. that.... I shan&rsquo;t realise Brussels and Belgium for
years because of that. They hated and killed me because
I was like that.... I must be like that ... something
comes along, <em>golden</em>, and presently there is a thought. I
can&rsquo;t be easy till I&rsquo;ve said it in my mind, and I&rsquo;m sad
till I have said it somehow ... and sadder when I have
said it. But nothing gets done. I must stop thinking,
from now, and be fearfully efficient. Then people will understand
and like me. They will hate me too, because I shall
be absurd, I shan&rsquo;t be really in it. Perhaps I shall. Perhaps
I shall get in. The wonder is they don&rsquo;t hate me more.
There was a stirring in the chair and a gushing of fresh
water into the tumbler. <em>Why</em> do I meet such nice people?
One after another. &ldquo;There&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think that will trouble you any more. We will make another
appointment.&rdquo; Miriam took the appointment book and a
card to the chair-side and stayed upstairs to clear up.

When she reached the hall Mr. Orly&rsquo;s door was standing
wide. Going into the surgery she found the head parlourmaid
rapidly wiping instruments with a soiled serviette. &ldquo;Is it all
right, James?&rdquo; she said vaguely, glancing round the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes miss,&rdquo; answered James briskly emptying the half-filled
tumbler and going on to dry and polish it with the
soiled serviette ... the housemaid spirit ... the dry corner
of a used serviette probably appeared to James much too
good to wipe anything with. Telling her would not be any
good. She would think it waste of time.... Besides,
Mr. Orly himself would not really mind; and the things
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
were &ldquo;mechanikly clean&rdquo; ... that was a good phrase
of Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s ... with his own things always soaking
even his mallets, until there was no polish left on the
handles; and his nailbrush in a bath of alcohol.... Mr.
Orly came in, large and spruce. He looked at his hands
and began combing his beard, standing before the overmantel.
&ldquo;Hancock busy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Frightfully busy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam looked judicially round the room. James hovered.
The north wind howled. The little strip of sky above the
outside wall that obscured the heavily stained glass of the
window seemed hardly to light the room and the little light
there was was absorbed by the heavy dull oak furniture and
the dark heavy Turkey carpet and dado of dull red and tarnished
gold.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It <em>is</em> dark for April&rdquo; murmured Miriam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
away your gold and tin box if I may.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank ye&rdquo; said Mr. Orly nervously, wheeling about
with a harsh sigh to scan the chair and bracket-table;
straightening his waistcoat and settling his tie. &ldquo;I got
through without it&mdash;used some of that new patent silicate
stuff of Leyton&rsquo;s. All right&mdash;show in the Countess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
James disappeared. Miriam secured the little box and
made off. On her table was a fresh pile of letters, annotated
in Mr. Orly&rsquo;s clear stiff upright rounded characters. She
went hurriedly through them. Extricating her blotter she
sat down and examined the inkstand. Of course one of her
pens had been used and flung down still wet with its nib
resting against the handle of the other pens.... Mr.
Leyton ... his gold filling; she ought to go in and see
if she could help ... perhaps he had finished by now. She
wiped away the ink from the nib and the pen-handles.
</p>

<p>
Tapping at Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s door she entered. He quickly
turned a flushed face his feet scrabbling noisily against the
bevelled base of the chair with the movement of his head.
&ldquo;Sawl right Miss Henderson. I&rsquo;ve finished. &rsquo;V&rsquo;you got
any emery strips&mdash;mine are all worn out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Back once more in her room she heard two voices talking
both at once excitedly in the den. Mrs. Orly had a morning
visitor. She would probably stay to lunch. She peered
into the little folding mirror hanging by the side of the
small mantelpiece and saw a face flushed and animated so
far. Her hair was as unsatisfactory as usual. As she looked
she became conscious of its uncomfortable weight pinned
to the back of her head and the unpleasant warm feeling
of her thick fringe. By lunch-time her face would be
strained and yellow with sitting at work in the cold room
with her feet on the oil-cloth under the window. She
glanced at the oil lamp standing in the little fireplace, its
single flame glaring nakedly against the red-painted radiator.
The telephone bell rang. Through the uproar of mechanical
sounds that came to her ear from the receiver she heard
a far off faint angry voice in incoherent reiteration. &ldquo;Hullo,
hullo&rdquo; she answered encouragingly. The voice faded but
the sounds went on punctuated by a sharp angry popping.
Mr. Orly&rsquo;s door opened and his swift heavy tread came
through the hall. Miriam looked up apprehensively, saying
&ldquo;Hullo&rdquo; at intervals into the angry din of the telephone.
He came swiftly on humming in a soft light baritone, his
broad forehead, bald rounded crown and bright fair beard
shining in the gloom of the hall. A crumpled serviette
swung with his right hand. Perhaps he was going to the
workshop. The door of the den opened. Mrs. Orly
appeared and made an inarticulate remark abstractedly
and disappeared. &ldquo;Hullo, hullo&rdquo; repeated Miriam busily
into the telephone. There was a loud report and the thin
angry voice came clear from a surrounding silence. Mr.
Orly came in on tiptoe, sighed impatiently and stood near
her drumming noiselessly on the table at her side. &ldquo;Wrong
number&rdquo; said Miriam, &ldquo;will you please ring off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a lot of trouble they givya&rdquo; said Mr. Orly.
&ldquo;I say, what&rsquo;s the name of the American chap Hancock
was talking about at lunch yesterday?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
Miriam frowned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can y&rsquo;remember? About sea-power.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; said Miriam relieved. &ldquo;Mahan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mahan. May-ann.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;ve got it. Wonderful. Don&rsquo;t forget
to send off Major Moke&rsquo;s case sharp will ye?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam&rsquo;s eyes scanned the table and caught sight of a
half hidden tin-box.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll get it off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right. It&rsquo;s in a filthy state, but there&rsquo;s no time to
clean it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He strode back through the hall murmuring Mahan.
Miriam drew the tin from its place of concealment. It
contained a mass of dirty cotton-wool upon which lay a
double denture coated with tartar and joined by tarnished
gold springs. &ldquo;Eleven thirty sharp&rdquo; ran the instruction
on an accompanying scrap of paper. No address. The
name of the patient was unfamiliar. Mrs. Orly put her
head through the door of the den.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did Ro want?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam turned towards the small sallow eager face and
met the kind sweet intent blue glint of the eyes. She
explained and Mrs. Orly&rsquo;s anxious little face broke into a
smile that dispelled the lines on the broad strip of low
forehead leaving it smooth and sallow under the smoothly
brushed brown hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How funny&rdquo; said Mrs. Orly hurriedly. &ldquo;I was just
comin&rsquo; out to ask you the name of that singer. You know.
Mark something. Marksy....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mar-kaysie&rdquo; said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I can&rsquo;t think how you remember.&rdquo; Mrs.
Orly disappeared and the two voices broke out again in
eager chorus. Miriam returned to her tin. Mastering her
disgust she removed the plate from the box, shook the
cotton-wool out into the paper-basket collected fresh wool,
packing paper, sealing wax, candle and matches and set
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
to work to make up the parcel. She would have to attack
the workshop again and get them to take it out. Perhaps
they would know the address. When the case was half
packed she looked up the patient&rsquo;s name in the ledger.
Five entries in about as many years&mdash;either repairs or springs&mdash;how
simple dentistry became when people had lost all
their teeth. There were two addresses, a town and a
country one written in a long time ago in ink; above them
were two in pencil, one crossed out. The newest of the
address books showed these two addresses, one in ink, neither
crossed out. What had become of the card and letter that
came with the case? In the den with Mrs. Orly and her
guest....
</p>

<p>
Footsteps were coming neatly and heavily up the basement
stairs. Winthrop. He came in smiling, still holding
his long apron gathered up to free his knees. &ldquo;Ph&mdash;Ph&mdash;Major
Moke&rsquo;s case ready?&rdquo; he whispered cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Almost&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know the address.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ph&mdash;ph&mdash;<em>Buck</em>inam Palace Otel. It&rsquo;s to go
by hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, thank goodness&rdquo; laughed Miriam sweeping the
scissors round the uneven edge of the wrapping paper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My <em>word</em>&rdquo; said Winthrop, &ldquo;What an eye you&rsquo;ve got
I couldn&rsquo;t do that to ph-save melife and I&rsquo;m supposed to be
a ph-mechanic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have I,&rdquo; said Miriam surprised, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be two
minutes; it&rsquo;ll be ready by the time anybody&rsquo;s ready to go.
But the letters aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll send up for them when we go out to
lunch,&rdquo; said Winthrop consolingly, disappearing.
</p>

<p>
Miriam found a piece of fine glazed green twine in her
string box and tied up the neat packet&mdash;sealing the ends
of the string with a neat blob on the upper side of the
packet and the folded paper at each end. She admired
the two firmly flattened ends of string close together. Their
free ends united by the firm red blob were a decorative
substitute for a stamp on the white surface of the paper.
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
She wrote in the address in an upright rounded hand with
firm rotund little embellishments. Poring over the result
she examined it at various distances. It was delightful.
She wanted to show it to someone. It would be lost on
Major Moke. He would tear open the paper to get at his
dreadful teeth. Putting the stamps on the label, she
regretfully resigned the packet and took up Mr. Orly&rsquo;s
day-book. It was in arrears&mdash;three, four days not entered
in the ledger. Major Moke repair&mdash;one guinea, she wrote.
Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s showing out bell rang. She took up her
packet and surveyed it upside down. The address looked like
Chinese. It was really beautiful ... but handwriting
was doomed ... short-hand and typewriting ... she ought
to know them if she were ever to make more than a pound
a week as a secretary ... awful. What a good thing Mr.
Hancock thought them unprofessional ... yet there were
already men in Wimpole Street who had their correspondence
typed. What did he mean by saying that the art of
conversation was doomed? He did not like conversation.
Jimmy came in for the parcel and scuttled downstairs
with it. Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s patient was going out through
the hall. He had not rung for her to go up. Perhaps there
was very little to clear and he was doing it himself.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-3-7">

<p class="noindent">
He was coming downstairs. Her hands went to the pile
of letters and busily sorted them. Through the hall. In
here. Leisurely. How are you getting on? Half amused.
Half solicitous. The first weeks. The first day. She had
only just come. Perhaps there would be the hand on the
back of the chair again as before he discovered the stiffness
like his own stiffness. He was coming right round to the
side of the chair into the light, waiting, without having
said anything. She seemed to sit through a long space
waiting for him to speak, in a radiance that shaped and
smoothed her face as she turned slowly and considered
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
the blunted grave features, their curious light, and met
the smiling grey eyes. They were not observing the confusion
on the table. He had something to say that had
nothing to do with the work. She waited startled into an
overflowing of the curious radiance, deepening the light in
which they were grouped. &ldquo;Are you busy?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said Miriam in quiet abandonment. &ldquo;I want your advice
on a question of decoration&rdquo; he pursued smiling down at
her with the expression of a truant schoolboy and standing
aside as she rose. &ldquo;My patient&rsquo;s put off&rdquo; he added confidentially,
holding the door wide for her. Miriam trotted
incredulously upstairs in front of him and in at the open
surgery door and stood contemplating the room from the
middle of the great square of soft thick grey green carpet
with her back to the great triple window and the littered
remains of a long sitting.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps a question of decoration meant altering the positions
of some of the pictures. She glanced about at them,
enclosed in her daily unchanging unsatisfying impressions&mdash;the
green landscape plumy with meadow-sweet, but not letting
you through to wander in fields, the little soft bright
coloury painting of the doorway of St. Mark&rsquo;s&mdash;San Marco,
painted by an Englishman, with a procession going in at the
door and beggars round the doorway, blobby and shapeless
like English peasants in Italian clothes ... bad ... and the
man had worked and studied and gone to Italy and had a
name and still worked and people bought his things ...
an engraving very fine and small of a low bridge in a little
town, quiet sharp cheering lines; and above it another
engraving, a tiresome troubled girl, all a sharp film of fine
woven lines and lights and shadows in a rich dark liny
filmy interior, neither letting you through nor holding
you up, the girl worrying there in the middle of the picture,
not moving, an obstruction.... Maris ... the two little
water colours of Devonshire, a boat with a brown sail and
a small narrow piece of a street zig-zagging sharply up
between crooked houses, by a Londoner&mdash;just to say how
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
crooked everything was ... that thing in this month&rsquo;s
Studio was better than any of these ... her heart throbbed
suddenly as she thought of it ... a narrow sandy pathway
going off, frilled with sharp greenery, far into a green wood....
Had he seen it? The studios lay safely there on the
polished table in the corner, the disturbing bowl of flowers
from the country, the great pieces of pottery, friends,
warm and sympathetic to touch, never letting you grow
tired of their colour and design ... standing out against
the soft dull gold of the dado and the bold soft green
and buff of the wall paper. The oil painting of the cousin
was looking on a little superciliously ... centuries of
&ldquo;fastidious refinement&rdquo; looking forth from her child&rsquo;s
face. If she were here it would be she would be consulted
about the decoration; but she was away somewhere in
some house, moving about in a dignified way under her
mass of gold hair, saying things when speech became a
necessity in the refined fastidious half-contemptuous tone,
hiding her sensitive desire for companionship, contemptuous
of most things and most people. To-day she had an
interested look, she was half jealously setting standards
for him all the time.... Miriam set her aside. The
Chinese figures staring down ferociously from the narrow
shelf running along the base of the high white frieze were
more real to her. They belonged to the daily life here,
secure from censure.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-3-8">

<p class="noindent">
From the brown paper wrappings emerged a large plaque
of Oriental pottery. Mr. Hancock man&oelig;uvred it upright,
holding it opposite to her on the floor, supported against his
knees. &ldquo;There&mdash;what do you think of that?&rdquo; he murmured
bending over it. Miriam&rsquo;s eyes went from the
veinings on his flushed forehead to the violent soft rich
red and blue and dull green covering the huge concave disc
from side to side. It appeared to represent a close thicket
of palm fronds, thin flat fingers, superimposed and splaying
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
out in all directions over the deep blue background. In
the centre appeared the head and shoulders of an enormous
tiger, coming sinuously forward, one great paw planted on
the greenery near the foremost middle edge of the plaque.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;M&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Miriam staring.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock rubbed the surface of the plaque with his
forefinger. Miriam came near and ran her finger down
across the rich smooth reliefs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where shall I put it?&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have it somewhere on that side of the room,
where the light falls on it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock raised the plaque in his arms and walked
with it to the wall raising it just above his head and holding
it in place between the two pictures of Devonshire. They
faded to a small muddled dinginess, and the buff and green
patterning of the wall-paper showed shabby and dim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It looks somehow too big or too small or something....
I should have it down level with the eyes, so that
you can look straight into it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock carefully lowered it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me come and hold it so that you can look&rdquo; said
Miriam advancing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too heavy for you&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock straining his
head back and moving it from side to side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe it would look best&rdquo; said Miriam &ldquo;across the
corner of the room as you come in&mdash;where the corner
cupboard is&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure it would&rdquo; she said eagerly and went
back to the centre of the carpet.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock smiled towards the small oak cupboard
fixed low in the angle of the wall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We should have to move the cupboard,&rdquo; he said dubiously
and carried the heavy plate to the indicated place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simply lovely&rdquo; said Miriam in delight as he held
the plaque in front of the long narrow façade of black oak.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock lowered the plaque to the floor and propped
it crosswise against the angle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would be no end of a business fixing it up&rdquo; he
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
murmured crossing to her side. They stood looking at the
beautiful surface blurred a little in the light by its backward
tilt. They gazed fascinated as the plaque slid gently
forward and fell heavily breaking into two pieces.
</p>

<p>
They regarded one another quietly and went forward
to gather up the fragments. The broken sides gritted
together as Miriam held hers steady for the other to be fitted
to it. When they were joined the crack was hardly visible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be a nice piece of work for Messrs. Nikkoo&rdquo;
said Mr. Hancock with a little laugh, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better get it
in back behind the sofa for the present.&rdquo; They spread
the brown paper over the brilliant surfaces and stood up.
Miriam&rsquo;s perceptions raced happily along. How had he
known that she cared for things? She was not sure that she
did ... not in the way that he did.... How did he know
that she had noticed any of his things? Because she had
blurted out &ldquo;Oh what a perfectly lovely picture&rdquo; when he
showed her the painting of his cousin? But that was because
he admired his cousin and her brother had painted the
picture and he admired them both and she had not known
about this when she spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you see this month&rsquo;s Studio?&rdquo; she asked shyly.
</p>

<p>
He turned to the table and took up the uppermost of the
pile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lovely green picture&rdquo; said Miriam, &ldquo;at
least I like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock turned pages ruminatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those are good things&rdquo; he said flattening the open
page.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Japanese flower Decorations&rdquo; read Miriam looking at
the reproduced squares of flowering branches arranged with
a curious naturalness in strange flat dishes. They fascinated
her at once&mdash;stiff and real, shooting straight up from the
earth and branching out. They seemed coloured. She
turned pages and gazed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How nice and queer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock bent smiling. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a whole science
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
of this you know&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it takes them years to learn
it; they apprentice themselves and study for years....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam looked incredulously at the simple effects&mdash;just
branches placed &ldquo;artistically&rdquo; in flat dishes and fixed somehow
at the base amongst little heaps of stones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It looks easy enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock laughed. &ldquo;Well&mdash;you try. We&rsquo;ll get some
broom or something, and you shall try your hand. You&rsquo;d
better read the article. Look here&mdash;they&rsquo;ve got names
for all the angles.... &lsquo;Shin&rsquo;&mdash;he read with amused
admiring delight, &lsquo;sho-shin&rsquo; ... there&rsquo;s no end of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam fired and hesitated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a sort of mathematics....
I&rsquo;m no good at mathematics.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect you could get very good results ... we&rsquo;ll try.
They carry it to such extraordinary lengths because there&rsquo;s all
sorts of social etiquette mixed up with it&mdash;you can&rsquo;t have a
branch pointing at a guest for instance&mdash;it would be rude.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No wonder it takes them years&rdquo; said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
They laughed together, moving vaguely about the room.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock looked thoughtfully at the celluloid tray of
hairpins on the mantelshelf, and blew the dust from it ...
there was something she remembered in some paper, very
forcibly written, about the falsity of introducing single
specimens of Japanese art, the last results of centuries of an
artistic discipline, that was it, that had grown from the life
of a secluded people living isolated in a particular spot under
certain social and natural conditions, into English household
decoration.... &ldquo;Gleanings in Buddha Fields&rdquo; the
sun on rice-fields ... and Fujiama&mdash;Fuji-no-San in the
distance ... but he did not like Hearn&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s something
in the chap that puts me off&rdquo; ... puts off&mdash;what a
good phrase ... &ldquo;something sensuous in him&rdquo; ... but
you could never forget Buddha Fields. It made you know
you were in Japan, in the picture of Japan ... and somebody
had said that all good art, all great art, had a sensuous
element ... it was dreadful, but probably true ... because
the man had observed it and was not an artist, but somebody
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
looking carefully on. Mr. Hancock, Englishman, was &ldquo;put
off&rdquo; by sensuousness, by anybody taking a delight in the
sun on rice fields and the gay colours of Japan ... perhaps
one ought to be &ldquo;put off&rdquo; by Hearn ... but Mr. Hancock
liked Japanese things and bought them and put them in
with his English things, that looked funny and tame beside
them. What he did not like was the expression of delight.
It was queer and annoying somehow ... especially as he said
that the way English women were trained to suppress their
feelings was bad. He had theories and fixed preferences
and yet always seemed to be puzzled about so many things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think it right to try to introduce single pieces
of Japanese art into English surroundings?&rdquo; she said tartly,
beginning on the instruments.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;East is East and West is West and never the twain can
meet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dreadful idea&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe it a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock laughed. He believed in those awful final
dreary-weary things ... some species are so widely differentiated
that they cannot amalgamate&mdash;awful ... but
if one said that he would laugh and say it was beyond him
... and he liked and disliked without understanding the
curious differences between people&mdash;did not know why they
were different&mdash;they put him off or did not put him off
and he was just. He liked and reverenced Japanese art and
there was an artist in his family. That was strange and fine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose we ought to have some face-powder here,&rdquo;
mused Mr. Hancock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take longer than ever if we do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know&mdash;that&rsquo;s the worst of it; but I commit such
fearful depredations ... we want a dressing room ...
if I had my way we&rsquo;d have a proper dressing room downstairs.
But I think we must get some powder and a puff....
Do you think you could get some...?&rdquo; Miriam
shrank. Once in a chemist&rsquo;s shop, in a strong Burlington
Arcade west-end mood buying some scent, she had seized
and bought a little box.... La Dorine de Poche ...
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
Dorin, Paris ... but that was different to asking openly
for powder and a puff ... la Dorine de Dorin Paris was
secret and wonderful.... &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try&rdquo; she said bravely
and heard the familiar little sympathetic laugh.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Lunch would be ready in a few minutes and none of the
letters were done. She glanced distastefully at the bold
handwritings scrawling, under impressive stamped addresses
with telephone numbers, and names of stations and telegraphic
addresses, across the well-shaped sheets of expensive
note-paper, to ask in long, fussy, badly-put sentences for
expensive appointments. Several of the signatures were
unfamiliar to her and must be looked up in the ledger in
case titles might be attached. She glanced at the dates
of the appointments&mdash;they could all go by the evening post.
What a good thing Mr. Hancock had given up overlooking
the correspondence. Mrs. Hermann&rsquo;s letter he should see
... but that could not anyhow have been answered by
return. The lunch-bell rang.... Mr. Orly&rsquo;s letters!
There was probably a telegram or some dreadful urgent
thing about one or other of them that ought to have been
dealt with. With beating heart she fumbled them through&mdash;each
one bore the word answered in Mrs. Orly&rsquo;s fine pointed
hand. Thank goodness. Opening a drawer she crammed
them into a crowded clip ... at least a week&rsquo;s addresses
to be checked or entered.... Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s unanswered
letters went into the same drawer, leaving her table fairly
clear. Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s door burst open, he clattered down
the basement stairs. Miriam went into his room and
washed her hands in the corner basin under the patent
unleaking taps. Everything was splashed over with permanganate
of potash. The smell of the room combined
all the dental drugs with the odour of leather&mdash;a volunteer
officer&rsquo;s accoutrements lay in confusion all over on the
secretaire. Beside them stood an open pot of leather

polish. Mr. and Mrs. Orly passed the open door and went
downstairs. They were alone. The guest had gone.

&ldquo;Come and share the remains of the banquet Miss
Hens&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Do</em> have just a bit of somethin&rsquo;, Ro darling, a bit of
chicking or somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Feeling the effects?&rdquo; remarked Mr. Leyton cheerfully
munching, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a patient at half past&rdquo; he added
nervously glancing up as if to justify his existence as well
as his remark. Miriam hoped he would go on; perhaps
it would occur to Mrs. Orly to ask him about the patient.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d feel the effects my boy if you hadn&rsquo;t had a wink
the whole blessed night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hancock busy Miss Hens&rsquo;?&rdquo; Miriam glanced at the
flushed forehead and hoped that Mr. Orly would remain
with his elbows on the table and his face hidden in his hands.
She was hungry and there would be no peace for anybody
if he were roused.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too many whiskies?&rdquo; enquired Mr. Leyton cheerfully,
shovelling salad on to his plate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too much whisking and frisking altogether sergeant,&rdquo;
said Mr. Orly incisively, raising his head.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Orly flushed and frowned at Mr. Orly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly Ley&mdash;you know how father hates dinner
parties.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Orly sighed harshly, pulling himself up as Miriam
began a dissertation on Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s crowded day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ze got someone with him now?&rdquo; put in Mrs. Orly
perfunctorily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wonderful man&rdquo; sighed Mr. Orly harshly, glancing
at his son.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have a bit of chicking Ro.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No my love no not all the perfumes of Araby&mdash;not
all the chickens of Cheshire. Have some paté Miss Hens&rsquo;&mdash;No?
You despise paté?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
A maid came briskly in and looked helpfully round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your half past one patient Ley?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Orly nervously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Buck&rdquo; rapped Mr. Leyton. &ldquo;We going to wait for
Mr. Hancock, Mater?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, of course not. Keep some things hot Emma and
bring in the sweets.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have some more chicken Miss Hens&rsquo;&mdash;Emma!&rdquo; he
indicated his son with a flourish of his serviette. &ldquo;Wait
upon Mr. Leyton, serve him speedily.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Emma arrested looked helpfully about, smiled in brisk
amusement, seized some dishes and went out.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Orly&rsquo;s pinched face expanded. &ldquo;Silly you are,
Ro.&rdquo; Miriam grinned, watching dreamily. Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s
flushed face rose and dipped spasmodically over the remains
of his salad.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bucking for Buck&rdquo;&mdash;laughed Mr. Orly in a soft
falsetto.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ro, you <em>are</em> silly, who&rsquo;s Buck, Ley?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t question the officer Nelly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ro, you <em>are</em> absurd,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Orly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Help the <em>jellies</em> dearest&rdquo; shouted Mr. Orly in a frowning
whisper. &ldquo;Have some jelly, Miss Hens&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s all right
Ley ... glad you so busy, my son. How many did you have
this morning?&rdquo; Mopping his brow and whisking his
person with his serviette he glanced sidelong.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Two&rdquo; said Mr. Leyton, noisily spooning up jelly,
&ldquo;any more of that stuff mater, how about Hancock?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty here&rdquo; said Mrs. Orly helping him.
Miriam laboured with her jelly and glanced at the dish.
People wolfed their food. It would seem so conspicuous
to begin again when the fuss had died down; with Mr.
Orly watching as if feeding were a contemptible self-indulgence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Had a beastly gold case half the morning&rdquo; rapped Mr.
Leyton and drank, with a gulp.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get any help?&rdquo; said Mr. Orly glancing at Miriam.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
&ldquo;No&rdquo; said Mr. Leyton in a non-committal tone, reaching
across the table for the cheese.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hancock too busy?&rdquo; asked Mr. Orly. &ldquo;Have some
more jelly, Miss Hens&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No thank you&rdquo; said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bit of cheese; a fragment of giddy Gorgonzola.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No thanks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Orly brushed busily at her bodice, peering down
with indrawn chin. The room was close with gas. If Mr.
Hancock would only come down and give her the excuse
of attending to his room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What you doing s&rsquo;aafnoon?&rdquo; asked Mr. Leyton.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I, my boy, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Orly with a heavy
sigh, &ldquo;string myself up, I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d much better string yourself round the Outer
Circle and take Lennard&rsquo;s advice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good advice my boy&mdash;if we all took good advice ...
eh Miss Hens&rsquo;n? I&rsquo;ve taken twenty grains of phenacetin
this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you go and get a good walk,&rdquo; said Mr. Leyton
clattering to his feet. &ldquo;S&rsquo;cuse me, Mater.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right my boy! Excellent! A Daniel come to judgment!
All right Ley&mdash;get on with you. Buck up and see
Buck. Oh-h-h my blooming head. Excuse my language
Miss Hens&rsquo;n. Ah! Here&rsquo;s the great man. Good morning
Hancock. How are you? D&rsquo;they know you&rsquo;re
down?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock murmured his greetings and sat down
opposite Miriam with a grave preoccupied air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Busy?&rdquo; asked Mr. Orly turning to face his partner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;fairly&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wonderful man.... Ley&rsquo;s gone off like a bee in a
gale. D&rsquo;they know Hancock&rsquo;s down Nelly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam glanced at Mr. Hancock wishing he could lunch
in peace. He was tired. Did he too feel oppressed with
the gas and the pale madder store cupboards? ... glaring
muddy hot pink?
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a blasted head on ... excuse my language.
Twenty of &rsquo;em, twenty to dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes?&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock shifting in his chair and
glancing about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Nelly!</em> D&rsquo;they know he&rsquo;s down? Start on a paté,
Hancock. The remains of the banquet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh ... well, thanks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You never get heads do ye?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock smiled and began a murmuring response
as he busied himself with his paté.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Ro he&rsquo;s got a most awful head.... How&rsquo;s your
uncle Mr. Hancock?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;thank you.... I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s not very flourishing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s better than he used to be, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes, I think perhaps on the whole he is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought to have been there, Hancock. Cleave came.
He was in no end of form. Told us some fine ones. Have a
biscuit and butter Miss Hens&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam refused and excused herself.
</p>

<p>
On her way upstairs she strolled into Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s
room. He greeted her with a smile&mdash;polishing instruments
busily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hancock busy?&rdquo; he asked briskly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;M&rsquo;m.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You busy? I say if I have Buck in will you finish up
these things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, if you like&rdquo; said Miriam, regretting her
sociable impulse. &ldquo;Is Mr. Buck here?&rdquo; She glanced at
the appointment book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s waiting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got anybody else this afternoon&rdquo; observed
Miriam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know. But I want to be down at Headquarters by
five in full kit if I possibly can. Has the Pater got anybody?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. The afternoon&rsquo;s marked off&mdash;he&rsquo;s going out, I
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
think. Look here, I&rsquo;ll clear up your things afterwards if
you want to go out. Will you want all these for Mr.
Buck?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;all right, thanks; I dunno. I&rsquo;ve got to finish
him off this afternoon and make him pay up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why pay up? Isn&rsquo;t he trustworthy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Trustworthy? A man who&rsquo;s just won three hundred
pounds on a horse and chucked his job on the strength
of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a fearfully insane thing to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lost his head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he very young?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oo&mdash;&rsquo;bout twenty-five.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. I spose he&rsquo;ll begin the rake&rsquo;s progress.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it. You&rsquo;ve just about hit it&rdquo; said Mr.
Leyton with heavy significance.
</p>

<p>
Miriam lingered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I boil every blessed thing after he&rsquo;s been ... if that&rsquo;s
any indication to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Boil</em> them!&rdquo; said Miriam vaguely distressed and pondering
over Mr. Leyton standing active and aseptic between
her and some horror ... something infectious ... it must
be that awful mysterious thing ... how awful for Mr.
Leyton to have to stop his teeth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Boil &rsquo;em&rdquo; he chuckled knowingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;there you are&rdquo; said Mr. Leyton&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all
I can tell you. I <em>boil</em> &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Crikey&rdquo; said Miriam half in response and half in
comment on his falsetto laugh, as she made for the door.
&ldquo;Oh, but I say, I don&rsquo;t understand your boiling apparatus,
Mr. Leyton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, don&rsquo;t you worry. I&rsquo;ll set it all going and
shove the things in. You&rsquo;ve only to turn off the gas and
wipe &rsquo;em. I daresay I shall have time to do them myself.&rdquo;

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
When she had prepared for Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s first afternoon
patient Miriam sat down at her crowded table in a
heavy drowse. No sound came from the house or from
the den. The strip of sky above the blank wall opposite
her window was an even cold grey. There was nothing
to mark the movement of the noisy wind. The room was
cold and stuffy. Shivering as she moved, she glanced round
at the lamp. It was well trimmed. The yellow flame was
at its broadest. The radiator glared. The warmth did not
reach her. She was cold to the waist, her feet without
feeling on the strip of linoleum; her knees protruding into
the window space felt as if they were in cold water. Her
arms crept and flushed with cold at every movement, strips
of cold wrist disgusted her, showing beyond her skimpy
sleeves and leading to the hopelessness of her purplish red
hands swollen and clammy with cold. Her hot head and
flushed cheeks begged for fresh air. Warm rooms, with
carpets and fires; an even, airy warmth.... There were
people who could be in this sort of cold and be active,
with cool faces and warm hands, even just after lunch.
If Mr. Leyton were here he would be briskly entering up
the books&mdash;perhaps with a red nose; but very brisk. He
was finishing Buck off; briskly, not even talking. Mr.
Hancock would be working swiftly at well up-to-date
accounts, without making a single mistake. Where had he
sat doing all those pages of beautiful spidery book-keeping?
Mr. Orly would be rushing things through. What a drama.
He knew it. He <em>knew</em> he had earned his rest by the fire
... doing everything, making and building the practice
... people waiting outside the surgery with basins for him
to rush out and be sick. Her sweet inaccurate help in the
fine pointed writing on cheap paper ... the two cheap
rooms they started in.... The Wreck of the <em>Mary
Gloucester</em> ... &ldquo;and never a doctor&rsquo;s brougham to help
the missis unload.&rdquo; They had been through everything
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
together ... it was all there with them now ... rushing
down the street in the snow without an overcoat to get
her the doctor. They were wise and sweet; in life and
wise and sweet. They had gone out and would be back
for tea. Perhaps they had gone out. Everything was so
quiet. Two hours of cold before tea. Putting in order
the materials for the gold and tin she propped her elbows
on the table and rested her head against her hands and
closed her eyes. There was a delicious drowsiness in her head
but her back was tired. She rose and wandered through
the deserted hall into the empty waiting room. The clear
blaze of a coal fire greeted her at the doorway and her cold
feet hurried in on to the warm Turkey carpet. The dark
oak furniture and the copper bowls and jugs stood in a
glow of comfort. From the centre of the great littered
table a bowl of daffodils asserted the movement of the
winter and pointed forward and away from the winter
stillness of the old room. The long faded rich crimson
rep curtains obscured half the width of each high window
and the London light screened by the high opposing houses
fell dimly on the dingy books and periodicals scattered
about the table. Miriam stood by the mantelpiece her
feet deep in the black sheepskin rug and held out her hands
towards the fire. They felt cold again the instant she withdrew
them from the blaze. The hall clock gonged softly
twice. The legal afternoon had begun. Anyone finding
her in here now would think she was idling. She glanced
at the deep dark shabby leather armchair near by and
imagined the relief that would come to her whole frame,
if she could relax into it for five undisturbed minutes.
The ringing of the front door bell sent her hurrying back
to her room.
</p>

<p>
The sound of reading came from the den&mdash;a word-mouthing
word-slurring monotonous drawl&mdash;thurrah-thurrah-thurrah;
thurrah thurrah ... a single beat, on
and on, the words looped and forced into it without any
discrimination, the voice dropping uniformly at the end
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
of each sentence ... <em>thrah</em>.... An Early Victorian voice
giving reproachful instruction to a child ... a class of
board school children reciting.... Perhaps they had
changed their minds about going out.... Miriam sat
with her hands tucked between her knees musing with her
eyes fixed on the thin sheets of tin and gold ... extraordinary
to read any sort of text like that ... but there was
something in it, something nice and good ... listening
carefully you would get most of the words. It would be
better to listen to than a person who read with intelligent
modulations, as if they had written the thing themselves;
like some men read ... and irritatingly intelligent women
... who knew they were intelligent. But there ought
to be clear ... enunciation. Not expression&mdash;that was
like commenting as you read; getting at the person you
were reading to ... who might not want to comment
in the same way. Reading, with expression, really hadn&rsquo;t
any expression. How wonderful&mdash;of course. Mrs. Orly&rsquo;s
reading had an expression; a shape. It was exactly like
the way they looked at things; exactly; everything was
there; all the things they agreed about, and the things
he admired in her ... things that by this time she knew
he admired.... She was conscious of these things ...
that was the difference between her and her sister, who
had exactly the same things but had never been admired
... standing side by side exactly alike, the sister like a
child&mdash;clear with a sharp fresh edge; Mrs. Orly with a
different wisdom ... softened and warm and blurred
... conscious, and always busy distracting your attention,
but with clear eyes like a child, too.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Presently the door opened quietly and Mrs. Orly appeared
in the doorway. &ldquo;Miss Hens&rsquo;n&rdquo; she whispered urgently.
Miriam turned to meet her flushed face. &ldquo;Oh Miss Hens&rsquo;n&rdquo;
she pursued absently, &ldquo;if Mudie&rsquo;s send d&rsquo;you mind lookin&rsquo;
and choosin&rsquo; us something nice?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; said Miriam provisionally with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Orly closed the door quietly and advanced confidently
with deprecating bright wheedling eyes. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
tahsome&rdquo; she said conversationally. &ldquo;Ro&rsquo;s asleep and the
carriage is comin&rsquo; round at half past. Isn&rsquo;t it tahsome?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you send it back?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want him to go out; I think the drive will do him
good. I say, d&rsquo;you mind just lookin&rsquo;&mdash;at the books?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I will; but how shall I know what to keep? Is
there a list?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Orly looked embarrassed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a list somewhere&rdquo;
she said hurriedly, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best&rdquo; said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>You</em> know&mdash;anythin&rsquo; historical ... there&rsquo;s one I put
down &lsquo;The Sorrows of a Young Queen.&rsquo; Keep that if
they send it and anything else you think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there anything to go back?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll bring them out. We&rsquo;ve been reading an awful
one&mdash;awful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam began fingering her gold foil. Mrs. Orly was
going to expect her to be shocked....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By that awful man Zola....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes&rdquo; said Miriam, dryly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you read any of his?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Miriam carefully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Have</em> you? Aren&rsquo;t they shockin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know. I thought &lsquo;Lourdes&rsquo; was simply
wonderful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that a nice one&mdash;what&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh you know&mdash;it&rsquo;s about the Madonna of Lourdes,
the miracles, in the south of France. It begins with a
crowded trainload of sick people going down through
France on a very hot day ... it&rsquo;s simply stupendous ...
you feel you&rsquo;re in the train, you go through it all&rdquo;&mdash;she
turned away and looked through the window overcome
... &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s a thing called &lsquo;La Rêve&rsquo;&rdquo; she went on
incoherently with a break in her voice &ldquo;about an embroideress
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
and a man called Felicien&mdash;it&rsquo;s simply the most
<em>lovely</em> thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Orly came near to the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You understand about books don&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; she said wistfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no&rdquo; said Miriam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hardly read anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d put those two down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the names of the translations,&rdquo; announced
Miriam with conceited solicitude.
</p>

<p>
A long loud yawn resounded through the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better, boysie?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Orly turning anxiously
towards the open door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my love,&rdquo; said Mr. Orly cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <em>am</em> glad, boy&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get my things on&mdash;the carriage&rsquo;ll
be here in a minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She departed at a run and Mr. Orly came in and sat
heavily down in a chair set against the slope of the wall
close by and facing Miriam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Phoo&rdquo; he puffed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been taking phenacetin all
day; you don&rsquo;t get heads do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam smiled and began preparing a reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s it coming in? Totting up, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think so&rdquo; said Miriam uneasily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it totting up to this month? Any idea?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; I can see if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, never mind.... Mrs. O&rsquo;s been reading
... phew! You&rsquo;re a lit&rsquo;ry young lady&mdash;d&rsquo;you know that
French chap&mdash;Zola&mdash;Emmil Zola&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Orly glanced
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like &rsquo;im?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Miriam firmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;it&rsquo;s a matter of taste and fancy&rdquo; sighed Mr.
Orly heavily. &ldquo;Chacun à son goût&mdash;shake an ass and go,
as they say. One&rsquo;s enough for me. I can&rsquo;t think why they
do it myself&mdash;sheer well to call a spade a spade sheer bestiality
those French writers&mdash;don&rsquo;t ye think so, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-59" class="pagenum" title="59"></a>
&ldquo;Well no. I don&rsquo;t think I can accept that as a summary
of French literature.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh well, it&rsquo;s beyond me. I suppose I&rsquo;m not up to it.
Behind the times. Not cultured enough. Not cultured
enough I guess. Ready dearest?&rdquo; he said addressing his
wife and getting to his feet with a groan. &ldquo;Miss Hens&rsquo;n&rsquo;s
a great admirer of Emmil Zola.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She says some of his books are pretty, didn&rsquo;t you, Miss
Hens&rsquo;n. It isn&rsquo;t fair to judge from one book, Ro.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No my love no. Quite right. Quite right. I&rsquo;m wrong&mdash;no
doubt. Getting old and soft. Things go on too fast
for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so silly, Ro.&rdquo;

Drowsily and automatically Miriam went on rolling tin
and gold&mdash;sliding a crisp thick foil of tin from the pink
tissue paper leaved book on to the serviette ... a firm
metallic crackle ... then a silent layer of thin gold ...
then more tin ... adjusting the three slippery leaves in
perfect superposition without touching them with her
hands, cutting the final square into three strips, with the
long sharp straight bladed scissors&mdash;the edges of the metal
adhering to each other as the scissors went along&mdash;thinking
again with vague distant dreamy amusement of the boy
who cut the rubber tyre to mend it&mdash;rolling the flat strips
with a fold of the serviette, deftly until they turned into
neat little twisted crinkled rolls&mdash;wondering how she had
acquired the knack. She went on and on lazily, unable to
stop, sitting back in her chair and working with outstretched
arms, until a small fancy soap box was filled with the twists&mdash;enough
to last the practice for a month or two. The
sight filled her with a sense of achievement and zeal. Putting
on its lid she placed the soap box on the second chair. Lazily,
stupidly, longing for tea&mdash;all the important clerical work
left undone, Mr. Orly&rsquo;s surgery to clear up for the day&mdash;still
<a id="page-60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a>
she was working in the practice. She glanced approvingly
at the soap box ... but there were ages to pass before
tea. She did not dare to look at her clock. Had the hall
clock struck three? Bending to a drawer she drew out a
strip of amadou&mdash;offended at the sight of her red wrist
coming out of the harsh cheap black sleeve and the fingers
bloated by cold. They looked lifeless; no one else&rsquo;s hands
looked so lifeless. Part of the amadou was soft and warm
to her touch, part hard and stringy. Cutting out a soft
square she cut it rapidly into tiny cubes collecting them
in a pleasant flummery heap on the blotting paper&mdash;Mr.
Hancock should have those; they belonged to his perfect
treatment of his patients; it was quite just. Cutting a
strip of the harsher part, she pulled and teased it into comparative
softness and cut it up into a second pile of fragments.
Amadou, gold and tin ... Japanese paper? A
horrible torpor possessed her. Why did one&rsquo;s head get into
such a hot fearful state before tea? ... grey stone wall
and the side of the projecting glass roofed peak of Mr.
Leyton&rsquo;s surgery ... grey stone wall ... wall ... railings
at the top of it ... cold&mdash;a cold sky ... it was their time&mdash;nine
to six&mdash;no doubt those people did best who thought
of nothing during hours but the work&mdash;cheerfully&mdash;but
they were always pretending&mdash;in and <em>out</em> of work hours
they pretended. There was something wrong in them and
something wrong in the people who shirked. La&mdash;te&mdash;ta&mdash;te&mdash;te&mdash;ta,
she hummed searching her table for relief.
Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s bell sounded and she fled up to the warmth
of his room. In a moment Mudie&rsquo;s cart came and the maid
summoned her. There was a pile of books in the hall....
She glanced curiously at the titles worried with the responsibility&mdash;&rsquo;The
Sorrows&rsquo;&mdash;that was all right. &lsquo;Secrets of a
Stormy Court&rsquo; ... that was the sort of thing ... &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear&rdquo; ... one day
she must explain to Mr. Orly that that was really
&ldquo;sousière&rdquo; a thing to hold halfpence. &lsquo;My Reminiscences&rsquo;
by Count de Something. Perhaps that was one
<a id="page-61" class="pagenum" title="61"></a>
they had put down. The maid presented the volumes
to be returned. Taking them Miriam asked her to ask
Mr. Hancock if he had anything to change. &lsquo;Cock Lane
and Common Sense&rsquo; she read ... there was some sort
of argument in that ... the &lsquo;facts&rsquo; of some case ... it
would sneer at something, some popular idea ... it was
probably by some doctor or scientific man ... but that
was not the book.... &lsquo;The Earth&rsquo; ... Emile Zola. She
flapped the book open and hurriedly read a few phrases.
The hall pulsated curiously. She flushed all over her body.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for Mr. Hancock, miss.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right;
these can go and these are to be kept,&rdquo; she said indistinctly.
Wandering back to her room she repeated the phrases in
her mind in French. They seemed to clear up and take
shelter&mdash;somehow they were terse and acceptable and they
were secret and secure&mdash;but English people ought not to
read them; in English. It was&mdash;outrageous. English men.
The French man had written them simply ... French
logic ... English men were shy and suggestive about these
things&mdash;either that or breezy ... &ldquo;filth&rdquo; which was almost
worse. The Orlys ought not to read them at all ... it was
a good thing the book was out of the house ... they would
forget. But she would not forget. Her empty room
glanced with a strange confused sadness; the clearing up
upstairs was not quite done; but she could not go upstairs
again yet. Three-fifteen; the afternoon had turned;
her clock was a little slow too. The warm quiet empty
den was waiting for the tea-tray. Clearing the remnants
from her table she sat down again. The heavy stillness
of the house closed in.... She opened the drawer of
stationery. Various kinds of notepaper lay slid together
in confusion; someone had been fumbling there. The
correspondence cards propped against the side of the drawer
would never stay in their proper places. With comatose
meticulousness she put the whole drawer in order, replenishing
it from a drawer of reserve packets, until it was so full
that nothing could slide. She surveyed the result with
<a id="page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
satisfaction; and shut the drawer. She would tidy one
drawer every afternoon.... She opened the drawer once
more and looked again. To keep it like that would mean
never using the undermost cards and notepaper. That
would not do ... change them all round sometimes. She
sat for a while inertly and presently lazily roused herself
with the idea of going upstairs. Pausing in front of a long
three-shelved whatnot filling the space between the door
and the narrow many drawered specimen case that stood
next her table she idly surveyed its contents. Nothing
but piles of British Dental Journals, Proceedings of the
Odontological Society, circulars from the Dental Manufacturing
Companies. Propping her elbows on the upper
shelf of the what-not she stood turning leaves.

&ldquo;Tea up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; said Miriam irritably, passing the open
door. He could see she had only just come down and could
not possibly know. The soft jingling of the cups shaken
together on a tray by labouring footsteps came from the
basement stairs. Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s hurried clattering increased.
Miriam waited impatiently by her table. The maid padded
heavily through swinging the door of the den wide with
her elbow. When she had retired, Miriam sauntered warm
and happy almost before she was inside the door into the
den. With her eyes on the tea-tray she felt the afternoon
expand.... &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Burma girl a settin&rsquo; and I know
she thinks of me.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;Come you <em>back</em> you British soldier,
come you <em>back</em> to Mandalay.&rdquo; Godfrey&rsquo;s tune was much
the best; stiff, like the words, the other was only sing-song.
Pushing off the distraction she sat down near the
gently roaring blaze of the gas fire in a low little chair,
upholstered in cretonne almost patternless with age. The
glow of the fire went through and through her. If she
had tea at once, everything would be richer and richer,
<a id="page-63" class="pagenum" title="63"></a>
but things would move on, and if they came back she
would have finished and would have to go. The face of
the railway clock fixed against the frontage of the gallery
at the far end of the room said four-fifteen. They had
evidently ordered tea to be a quarter of an hour late and
might be in any minute ... this curious feeling that the
room belonged to her more than to the people who owned
it, so that they were always intruders.... Leaving with
difficulty the little feast untouched ... a Dundee cake
from Buszards ... she browsed rapidly, her eyes roaming
from thing to thing ... the shields and assegais grouped
upon the raised dull gold papering of the high opposite
wall, the bright beautiful coloured bead skirts spread out
amongst curious carved tusks and weapons, the large cool
placid gold Buddha reclining below them with his chin
on his hand and his elbow on a red velvet cushion, on the
Japanese cabinet; the Japanese cupboard fixed above Mrs.
Orly&rsquo;s writing table, the fine firm carved ivory on its panels;
the tall vase of Cape gooseberries flaring on the top of the
cottage piano under the shadow of the gallery; the gallery
with its upper mystery, the happy clock fastened against
its lower edge, always at something after four, the door
set back in the wall, leading into her far-away midday room,
the light falling from the long high frosted window along
the confusion of Mr. Orly&rsquo;s bench, noisy as she looked at it
with the sound of metal tools falling with a rattle, the
drone and rattle of the motor lathe, Mr. Orly&rsquo;s cheerful
hummings and whistlings, the bench swept down the length
of the room to her side ... the movable shaded electric
lamp; Mr. Orly&rsquo;s African tobacco pouch bunched underneath
it on the edge of the bench near the old leather armchair
near to the fire, facing the assegais; the glass-doored
bookcase on either side of the fireplace, the strange smooth
gold on the strips of Burmese wood fastened along the
shelves, the clear brown light of the room on the gold,
the curious lettering sweeping across the gold.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tea? Good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-64" class="pagenum" title="64"></a>
Mr. Leyton pulled up a chair and plumped into it digging
at his person and dragging out the tails of his coat with one
hand, holding a rumpled newspaper at reading length.
When his coat-tails were free he scratched his head and
scrubbed vigorously at his short brown beard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You had tea?&rdquo; he said to Miriam&rsquo;s motionlessness,
without looking up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;let&rsquo;s have tea,&rdquo; said Miriam. Why should he
assume that she should pour out the tea....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <em>say</em> that&rsquo;s a <em>nasty</em> one&rdquo; said Mr. Leyton hysterically
and began reading in a high hysterical falsetto.
</p>

<p>
Miriam began pouring out. Mr. Leyton finished his
passage with a little giggling shriek of laughter and fumbled
for bread and butter with his eyes still on the newspaper.
Miriam sipped her hot tea. The room darkled in the silence.
Everything intensified. She glanced impatiently at Mr.
Leyton&rsquo;s bent unconscious form. His shirt and the long
straight narrow ends of his tie made a bulging curve above
his low-cut waistcoat. The collar of his coat stood away
from his bent neck and its tails were bunched up round his
hips. His trousers were so hitched up that his bent knees
strained against the harsh crude Rope Brothers cloth. The
ends of his trousers peaked up in front, displaying loose
rolls of black sock and the whole of his anatomical walking-shoes.
Miriam heard his busily masticating jaws and dreaded
his operations with his tea-cup. A wavering hand came out
and found the cup and clasped it by the rim, holding it at
the edge of the lifted newspaper. She busied herself with
cutting stout little wedges of cake. Mr. Leyton sipped,
gasping after each loud quilting gulp; a gasp, and the sound
of a moustache being sucked. Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s showing out
bell rang. Mr. Leyton plunged busily round, finishing his
cup in a series of rapid gulps. &ldquo;Kike?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;M&rdquo; said Miriam, &ldquo;jolly kike&mdash;did you finish Mr.
Buck?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More or less&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you boil the remains?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-65" class="pagenum" title="65"></a>
&ldquo;Boiled every blessed thing&mdash;and put the serviette in
k&rsquo;bolic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam hid her relief and poured him out another cup.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock came in through the open door and quickly
up to the tea-tray. Pouring out a cup he held the teapot
suspended, &ldquo;another cup?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No thanks, not just at present&rdquo; said Miriam getting
to her feet with a morsel of cake in her fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Plenty of time for my things&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock sitting
down in Mr. Orly&rsquo;s chair with his tea, his flat compact
slightly wrinkled and square-toed patent leather shoes
gleamed from under the rims of his soft dark grey beautifully
cut trousers with a pleasant shine as he sat back comfortable
and unlounging, with crossed knees in the deep chair.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leyton had got to his feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Busy?&rdquo; he said rapidly munching. &ldquo;I say I&rsquo;ve had
that man Buck this afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock brushing a crumb from
his knee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>You</em> know&mdash;that case I told you about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes?&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock with a clear glance and a
slight tightening of the face.
</p>

<p>
Miriam made for the door. Mr. Hancock was not
encouraging the topic. Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s cup came down with
a clatter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fearfully rushed&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must be
off.&rdquo; He caught Miriam up in the hall. &ldquo;I say tea must
have been fearfully late. I&rsquo;ve got to get down to headquarters
by five <em>sharp</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You go on first&rdquo; said Miriam standing aside.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leyton fled up through the house three steps at a
time.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
When she came down again intent on her second cup of
tea in the empty brown den a light had been switched on,
driving the dark afternoon away. The crayon drawings
behind the piano shone out on the walls of the dark square
<a id="page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>
space under the gallery as she hesitated in the doorway.
There was someone in the dim brightness of the room.
She turned noiselessly towards her table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come and have some more tea Miss Hens&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam went in with alacrity. The light was on in the
octagonal brass framed lantern that hung from the skylight
and shed a soft dim radiance through its old glass.
Mrs. Orly still in her bonnet and fur-lined cape was sitting
drinking tea in the little old cretonne chair. She raised a
tired flushed face and smiled brightly at Miriam as she came
down the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying for another cup; I had to fly off and clear
up Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hancock busy? Have some cake, it&rsquo;s rather a
nice one.&rdquo; Mrs. Orly cut a stout little wedge.
</p>

<p>
Clearing away the newspaper Miriam took possession of
Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s chair.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Orly swung in shutting the door behind him and
down the room peeling off his frock coat as he came.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tea darling?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well m&rsquo;love, since you&rsquo;re so pressing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Orly switched on the lamp on the corner of the
bench and subsided into his chair his huge bulk poised
lightly and alertly, one vast leg across the other knee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse my shirt-sleeves Miss Hens&rsquo;n. I say I&rsquo;ve got a
new song&mdash;like to try it presently or are ye too busy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poised between the competing interests of many worlds
Miriam basked in the friendly tones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I <em>have</em> got rather a fearful lot of things to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come and try it now, d&rsquo;ye mind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have your tea Ro, darling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right my love, right, right, always right&mdash;Hancock
busy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he has two more patients after this one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Marvellous man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hancock never gets rushed or flurried does he?
He&rsquo;s always been the same ever since we&rsquo;ve known him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very even and steady outwardly&rdquo; said Miriam
indifferently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s only outward?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I mean he&rsquo;s really frightfully sensitive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just so; it&rsquo;s his coolness carries him through, self-command,
I wish I&rsquo;d got it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d miss other things boysie; you can&rsquo;t have it both
ways.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right m&rsquo;love&mdash;right. I don&rsquo;t understand him. D&rsquo;you
think anyone does, Miss Hens&rsquo;n&mdash;really&mdash;I mean. D&rsquo;you
understand him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well you see I haven&rsquo;t known him very long&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;but you come from the same district and know
his relatives.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The same Berkshire valley and his cousins happened to
be my people&rsquo;s oldest friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t ye see, that makes all the difference&mdash;I say
I heard a splendid one this afternoon. D&rsquo;you think I could
tell Miss Hens&rsquo;n that one Nelly?&mdash;you&rsquo;re not easily shocked,
are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been shocked in my life&rdquo; said Miriam
getting to her feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Must ye go? Shall we just try this over?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well if it isn&rsquo;t too long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop and have a bit of dinner with us can ye?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam made her excuse, pleading an engagement and sat
down to the piano. The song was a modern ballad with an
easy impressive accompaniment, following the air. The
performance went off easily and well, Mr. Orly&rsquo;s clear
trained baritone ringing out persuasively into the large
room. Weathering a second invitation to spend the evening
she got away to her room.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Her mind was alight with the sense of her many beckoning
interests, aglow with fulness of life. The thin piercing
light cast upon her table by the single five candle power
<a id="page-68" class="pagenum" title="68"></a>
bulb, drawn low and screened by a green glass shade was
warm and friendly. She attacked her letters, despatching
the appointments swiftly and easily in a bold convincing
hand and drafted a letter to Mrs. Hermann that she carried
with a glow of satisfaction to Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s room. When
his room was cleared in preparation for his last patient it
was nearly six o&rsquo;clock. She began entering his day-book in
the ledger. The boy coming up for the letters brought two
dentures to be packed and despatched by registered post
from Vere Street before six o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be ready
by the time you&rsquo;ve got your boots on&rdquo; said Miriam and
packed her cases brilliantly in a mood of deft-handed
concentration. Jimmy clattered up the stairs as she was
stamping the labels. When he fled with them she gave a
general sigh and surveyed the balance of her day with a
responsible cheerful wicked desperation; her mind leaping
forward to her evening. The day books would not be done,
even Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s would have to go up unentered; she
had not the courage to investigate the state of the cash
book; Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s room was ready for the morning;
she ran through to Mr. Orly&rsquo;s room and performed a rapid
perfunctory tidying up; many little things were left;
his depleted stores must be refilled in the morning; she
glanced at his appointment book, no patient so far until
ten. She left the room with her everyday guilty consciousness
that hardly anything in it was up to the level of Mr.
Hancock&rsquo;s room ... look after Hancock, I&rsquo;m used to
fending for myself ... but he knew she did not do her
utmost to keep the room going. There were times when
he ran short of stores in the midst of a sitting. That could
be avoided.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-3-17">

<p class="noindent">
When Miriam entered his room at half past six Mr.
Hancock was switching off the lights about the chair. A
single light shone over his desk. The fire was nearly out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Still here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-69" class="pagenum" title="69"></a>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Miriam switching on a light over the instrument
cabinet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should leave those things tonight if I were you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She could go on, indefinitely, in this confident silence,
preparing for the next day. He sat making up his day-book
and would presently come upon Mrs. Hermann&rsquo;s
letter. As long as he was there the day lingered. Its light
had left the room. The room was colourless and dark
except where the two little brilliant circles of light made
bright patches of winter evening. Their two figures quietly
at work meant the quiet and peace of the practice; the
full, ended day, to begin again to-morrow in broad daylight
in this same room. The room was full of their quiet continuous
companionship. It was getting very cold. He
would be going soon.
</p>

<p>
He stood up, switching off his light. &ldquo;That will do
excellently&rdquo; he said with an amused smile, placing Mrs.
Hermann&rsquo;s letter on the flap of the instrument cabinet
and wandering into the gloomy spaces.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Well.</em> I&rsquo;ll say good night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good night&rdquo; murmured Miriam.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the dried instruments in a heap with a wash
leather flung over them she gathered up the books switched
the room into darkness, felt its promise of welcome and
trotted downstairs through the quiet house. The front
door shut quietly on Mr. Hancock as she reached the hall.
She flew to get away. In five minutes the books were in
the safe and everything locked up. The little mirror on
the wall, scarcely lit by the single globe over the desk just
directed the angle of her hat and showed the dim strange
eager outline of her unknown face. She fled down the hall
past Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s room and the opening to the forgotten
basement, between the heavy closed door of Mr. Orly&rsquo;s
room and the quiet scrolled end of the balustrade and past
the angle of the high dark clock staring with its unlit face
down the length of the hall, between the high oak chest
<a id="page-70" class="pagenum" title="70"></a>
and the flat oak coffer confronting each other in the glooms
thrown by Mrs. Orly&rsquo;s tall narrow striped Oriental curtains;
she saw them standing in straight folds, the beautiful
height and straightness of their many coloured stripes, as
they must have been before the outside stripe of each had
been cut and used as a tie-up; and was out beyond the
curtains in the brightly lit square facing the door. The
light fell on the rich edge of the Turkey carpet and the
groove of the bicycle stand. In the corner stood the blue
and white pipe, empty of umbrellas. Her hand grasped the
machine-turned edge of the small flat circular knob that
released the door ... brahma; that was the word, at
last.... The door opened and closed with its familiar
heavy wooden firmness, neatly, with a little rattle of its
chain. Her day scrolled up behind her. She halted,
trusted and responsible, for a long second in the light flooding
the steps from behind the door.
</p>

<p>
The pavement was under her feet and the sparsely
lamplit night all round her. She restrained her eager steps
to a walk. The dark houses and the blackness between the
lamps were elastic about her.

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hen</span> she came to herself she was in the Strand.
She walked on a little and turned aside to look at
a jeweller&rsquo;s window and consider being in the Strand at
night. Most of the shops were still open. The traffic was
still in full tide. The jeweller&rsquo;s window repelled her. It
was very yellow with gold, all the objects close together
and each one bearing a tiny label with the price. There
was a sort of commonness about the Strand, not like the
cheerful commonness of Oxford Street, more like the City
with its many sudden restaurants. She walked on. But
there were theatres also, linking it up with the west-end
and streets leading off it where people like Bob Greville
had chambers. It was the tailing off of the west-end and
the beginning of a deep dark richness that began about Holywell.
Mysterious important churches crowded in amongst
little brown lanes ... the little dark brown lane.... She
wondered what she had been thinking since she left Wimpole
Street and whether she had come across Trafalgar Square
without seeing it or round by some other way. They
were <em>fighting</em>; sending out suffocation and misery into the
surrounding air ... she stopped close to the two upright
balanced threatening bodies, almost touching them. The
men looked at her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&rdquo; she said imploringly and
hurried on trembling.... It occurred to her that she
had not seen fighting since a day in her childhood when
she had wondered at the swaying bodies and sickened at
the thud of a fist against a cheek. The feeling was the same
to-day, the longing to explain somehow to the men that
<a id="page-72" class="pagenum" title="72"></a>
they <em>could</em> not fight.... Half-past seven. Perhaps there
would not be an A.B.C. so far down. It would be impossible
to get a meal. Perhaps the girls would have some coffee.
An A.B.C. appeared suddenly at her side, its panes misty
in the cold air. She went confidently in. It seemed nearly
full of men. Never mind, city men; with a wisdom of
their own which kept them going and did not affect anything,
all alike and thinking the same thoughts; far away
from anything she thought or knew. She walked confidently
down the centre, her plaid-lined golf-cape thrown
back her small brown boat-shaped felt hat suddenly hot
on her head in the warmth. The shop turned at a right
angle showing a large open fire with a fireguard, and a cat
sitting on the hearthrug in front of it. She chose a chair
at a small table in front of the fire. The velvet settees
at the sides of the room were more comfortable. But it
was for such a little while to-night and it was not one of
her own A.B.Cs. She felt as she sat down as if she were
the guest of the city men and ate her boiled egg and roll
and butter and drank her small coffee in that spirit-gazing
into the fire and thinking her own thoughts unresentful
of the uncongenial scraps of talk that now and again penetrated
her thoughts; the complacent laughter of the men
amazed her; their amazing unconsciousness of the things
that were written all over them.
</p>

<p>
The fire blazed into her face. She dropped her cape
over the back of her chair and sat in the glow; the small
pat of butter was not enough for the large roll. Pictures
came out of the fire, the strange moment in her room,
the smashing of the plaque, the lamplit den; Mr. Orly&rsquo;s
song, the strange rich difficult day and now her untouched
self here, free, unseen and strong, the strong world of
London all round her, strong free untouched people, in
a dark lit wilderness happy and miserable in their own way,
going about the streets looking at nothing, thinking about
no special person or thing, as long as they were there, being
in London.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-73" class="pagenum" title="73"></a>
Even the business people who went about intent, going
to definite places were in the secret of London and looked
free. The expression of the collar and hair of many of
them said they had homes. But they got away from them.
No one who had never been alone in London was quite
alive.... I&rsquo;m free&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got free&mdash;nothing can ever alter
that she thought, gazing wide-eyed into the fire, between
fear and joy. The strange familiar pang gave the place a
sort of consecration. A strength was piling up within her.
She would go out unregretfully at closing time and up
through wonderful unknown streets, not her own streets
till she found Holborn and then up and round through the
Squares.

On the hall table lay a letter ... from Alma; under
the shadow of the bronze soldier leaning on his gun. Miriam
gathered it up swiftly. No one knew her here ... no past
and no future ... coming in and out unknown, in the
present secret wonder. Pausing for a moment near the
smeary dimly-lit marble slab the letter out of sight she
held this consciousness. There was no sound in the house
... its huge high thick walls held all the lodgers secure
and apart, fixed in richly enclosed rooms in the heart of
London; secure from all the world that was not London,
flying through space, swinging along on a planet spread
with continents&mdash;Londoners. Alma&rsquo;s handwriting, the
same as it had been at school only a little larger and firmer,
broke into that. Of course Alma had answered the postcard
... it had been an impulse, a cry of triumph after
years of groping about. But it was like pulling a string.
Silly. And now this had happened. But it was only a
touch, only a finger laid on the secret hall table that no
one had seen. The letter need not be answered. Out of
sight it seemed to have gone away ... destroyed unopened
it would be as if it had never come and everything would
be as before.... Enough, more than enough without
<a id="page-74" class="pagenum" title="74"></a>
writing to Alma. An evening paper boy was shouting
raucously in the distance. The letter-box brought his
voice into the hall as he passed the door. Miriam moved
on up the many flights.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-4-3">

<p class="noindent">
Upstairs she found herself eagerly tearing open the
letter.... &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just heard from an old schoolfellow&rdquo; she
heard herself saying to the girls in Kennett Street. There
was something exciting in the letter ... at the end Alma
Wilson (officially Mrs. G. Wilson) ... strange people in
the room ... Alma amongst them; looking out from
amongst dreadfulness. <em>Married.</em> She had gone in amongst
the crowd already&mdash;forever. How clever of her ...
deceitful ... that little spark of Alma in her must have
been deceitful ... sly, at some moment. Alma&rsquo;s eyes
glanced at her with a new more preoccupied and covered
look ... she used to go sometimes to theatres with large
parties of people with money and the usual dresses who
never thought anything about anything ... perhaps that
was part of the reason, perhaps Alma was more that than she
had thought ... marrying in the sort of way she went to
theatre-parties&mdash;clever. The letter was full of excitement
... Alma leaping up from her marriage and clutching at
her ... not really married; dancing to some tune in
some usual way like all those women and jumping up in a
way that fizzled and could not be kept up....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You dear old thing! ... fell out of the sky this morning
... to fill pages with &lsquo;you dear old thing!&rsquo; ...
see you at <em>once</em>! <em>Immediately!</em> ... come up to town and
meet you ... some sequestered tea-shop ... our ancient
heads together ... tell you all that has happened to me
since those days ... next Thursday ... let you know
how really really rejoiced I am ... break the very elderly
fact that I am married ... but that makes no difference....&rdquo;
That would not be so bad&mdash;seeing Alma alone in
a tea shop in the west end; in a part of the new life, that
<a id="page-75" class="pagenum" title="75"></a>
would be all right; nothing need happen, nothing would
be touched, &ldquo;all I have had the temerity to do ...&rdquo; what
did that mean?

<p class="noindent">
Unpinning the buckram-stiffened black velvet band from
her neck, she felt again with a rush of joy that her day was
beginning and moved eagerly about amongst the strange
angles and shadows of her room, the rich day all about her.
Somebody had put up her little varnished oak bookshelf
just in the right place, the lower shelf in a line with the
little mantelpiece. When the gas bracket was swung
out from the wall the naked flame shone on the backs
of the indiscriminately arranged books ... the calf-bound
Shakespeare could be read now comfortably in the
immense fresh dark night under the gas flame; the Perne&rsquo;s
memorial edition of Tennyson.... She washed her face
and hands in hard cold water at the little rickety washstand,
yellow-grained rich beloved, drying them on the thin holey
face towel hurriedly. Lying neatly folded amongst the
confusion of oddments in a top drawer was her lace tie.
Holding it out to its full length she spread it against her
neck, crossed the ends at the back bringing them back
round her neck to spread in a narrow flat plastron to her
waist, kept in place by a brooch at the top and a pin fastened
invisibly half way down. Her face shone fresh and young
above the creamy lace ... the tie was still fairly new and
crisp ... when it had to be washed it would be limp ...
but it would go on some time just for evenings transforming
her harsh black John Doble half guinea costume into evening
dress. For some moments she contemplated its pleasant
continuous pattern and the way the rounded patterned ends
fell just below the belt....

<p class="noindent">
The top-floor bell would not ring. After some hesitation
Miriam rang the house bell. The door was opened by a
<a id="page-76" class="pagenum" title="76"></a>
woman in a silk petticoat and a dressing jacket. Miriam
gazed dumbly into large clear blue eyes gazing at her from
a large clean clear fresh face feathered with little soft
natural curls, cut out sharply against the dark passage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you for the top?&rdquo; enquired the woman in a smooth
serene sleepy voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; announced Miriam eagerly coming in and closing
the door, her ears straining to catch the placid words spoken
by the woman as she disappeared softly into a softly-lit
room. She went tremulously up the dark stairs into a thick
stale odour of rancid fried grease and on towards a light
that glimmered from the topmost short flight of steep
uncarpeted winding stairs. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in&rdquo; said her thoughts
with a quick warm leap. &ldquo;Hullo&rdquo; she asserted, ascending
the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo&rdquo; came in response a quick challenging voice
... a soft clear reed-like happy ring that Miriam felt to
her knees while her happy feet stumbled on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that the Henderson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&rdquo; said Miriam emerging on a tiny landing and
going through the open door of a low-ceiled lamplit room.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me it&rsquo;s me&rdquo; she repeated from the middle of the floor.
An eager face was turned towards her from a thicket of
soft dull wavy hair. She gazed vaguely. The small slippered
feet planted firmly high up against the lintel the sweep of
the red dressing-gown, the black patch of the Mudie book
with its yellow label, the small ringed hand upon it, the
outflung arm and hand the little wreath of smoke about
the end of the freshly lit cigarette, the cup of coffee on the
little table under the lamp, the dim shapes about the room
lit by the flickering blaze....
</p>

<p>
Miriam smiled into the smiling steel blue of the eyes
turned towards her and waited smiling for the silver reed
of tone to break again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come. I
wanted you. Sit down and shut the door my child....
I don&rsquo;t mind which you do first, but&mdash;do&mdash;them&mdash;both,&rdquo;
she tinkled, stretching luxuriously and bringing her feet
<a id="page-77" class="pagenum" title="77"></a>
to the ground with a swing. Miriam closed the door.
&ldquo;Can I take off my things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course child ... take them all off; you know I
admire you most draped in a towel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got such awful feet&rdquo; said Miriam hugging the
compliment as she dropped her things in a distant arm-chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your feet, it&rsquo;s your extraordinary shoes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;M.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How beautiful you look. You put on ties better than
anyone I know. I wish I could wear things draped round my
neck.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam sat down in the opposite wicker chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it cold&mdash;my feet are freezing; it&rsquo;s raining.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take off your shoes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam got off her shoes and propped them in the fender
to dry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that book?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eden Philpotts&rsquo;s &lsquo;Children of the Mist&rsquo;&rdquo; fluted the
voice reverently. &ldquo;Read it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&rdquo; said Miriam expectantly.
</p>

<p>
The eager face turned to an eager profile with eyes
brooding into the fire. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so wonderful&rdquo; mused the
voice and Miriam watched eagerly. Mag read books&mdash;for
their own sake; and could judge them and compare them
with other books by the same author ... but all this
wonderful knowledge made her seem wistful; knowing all
about books and plays and strangely wistful and regretful;
the things that made her eyes blaze and made her talk
reverently or in indignant defence always seemed sad in
the end ... wistful hero worship ... raving about certain
writers and actors as if she did not know they were people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so wonderful&rdquo; went on the voice with its perpetual
modulations &ldquo;he gets all the atmosphere of the west
country&mdash;perfectly. You <em>live</em> there while you&rsquo;re reading
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a little chill sense of Mag in this wonderful room
alone, living in the west country and herself coming in as
<a id="page-78" class="pagenum" title="78"></a>
an interruption, Miriam noted the name of the novelist
in her mind ... there was something about it, she knew
she would not forget it; soft and numb with a slight clatter
and hiss at the end, a rain-storm, the atmosphere of Devonshire
and the mill-wheel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Devonshire people are all consumptive,&rdquo; she said decisively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s the mild damp air. They have lovely complexions;
like the Irish. There must be any amount of
consumption in Ireland.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose there is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam sat silent and still watching Mag&rsquo;s movements
as she sipped and puffed, so strangely easy and so strangely
wistful in her wonderful rich Bloomsbury life&mdash;and waiting
for her next remark.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look very happy tonight child; what have you
been doing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look as happy as a bird.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are birds happy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of <em>course</em> birds are happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;they prey on each other&mdash;and they&rsquo;re often
frightened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How wise we are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brisk steps sounded on the little stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me what you have been doing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh. I don&rsquo;t know. Weird things have been happening....
Oh, weird things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell your aunt at once.&rdquo; Mag gathered herself together
as the brisk footsteps came into the room. &ldquo;Hoh&rdquo; said a
strong resonant voice &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the Henderson. I thought as
much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Doesn&rsquo;t she look pretty?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;she has a beautiful lace tie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I could wear things like that round my neck,
don&rsquo;t you von Bohlen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-79" class="pagenum" title="79"></a>
&ldquo;I <em>do</em>. She can stick <em>anything</em> round her neck&mdash;and look
nice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anything; a garter or a&mdash;a <em>kipper</em>....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so cracked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She says weird things have been happening to her. I
say I didn&rsquo;t make any coffee for you and the spirit lamp
wants filling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn you&mdash;Schweinhund&mdash;verfluchte Schweinhund.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam had been gazing at the strong square figure in the
short round fur-lined cloak and sweeping velvet hat, the
firm decisive movements and imagining the delicate pointed
high-heeled shoes. Presently those things would be off and
the door closed on the three of them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some Bass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have some suppe. Have some suppe,
Henderson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Non, merci.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s proud. Bring her some. What did you have for
supper, child?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, we had an enormous lunch. They&rsquo;d had a dinner-party.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you have for supper?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh lots of things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bring her some suppe. I&rsquo;m not sure I won&rsquo;t have a
basin myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll put some on.&rdquo; The brisk steps went off
and a voice hummed in and out of the other rooms.
</p>

<p>
Watching Mag stirring the fire, giving a last pull at her
cigarette end and pushing back the hair from her face
... silent and old and ravaged, and young and animated
and powerful, Miriam blushed and beamed silently at her
reiterated demands for an account of herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say I saw an extraordinary woman downstairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mag turned sharply and put down the poker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In a petticoat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Frederika Elizabeth! She&rsquo;s seen the Pierson!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-80" class="pagenum" title="80"></a>
&ldquo;Hoh! Has she?&rdquo; The brisk footsteps approached
and the door was closed. The dimly shining mysteries of
the room moved about Miriam, the outside darkness flowing
up to the windows moved away as the tall dressing-gowned
figure lowered the thin drab loosely rattling Venetian
blinds; the light seemed to go up and distant objects
became more visible; the crowded bookshelf the dark
littered table under it, the empty table pushed against
the wall near the window&mdash;the bamboo bookshelf between
the windows above a square mystery draped to the ground
with a table cover&mdash;the little sofa behind Mag&rsquo;s chair, the
little pictures, cattle gazing out across a bridge of snow,
cattish complacent sweepy women. Albert...? Moore?
the framed photographs of Dickens and Irving, the litter
on the serge draped mantelpiece in front of the mirror of
the bamboo overmantel, silver candlesticks, photographs
of German women and Canon Wilberforce ... all the
riches of comfortable life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes I am fear-fully late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why are you late Frederika Elizabeth von Bohlen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The powerful rounded square figure was in the leather
armchair opposite the blaze, strongly moulded brown
knickered black stockinged legs comfortably crossed stuck
firmly out between the heavy soft folds of a grey flannel
dressing gown. The shoes had gone, grey woollen bedroom
slippers blurred all but the shapely small ankles.
Mag was lighting another cigarette, von Bohlen was not
doing needlework, the room settled suddenly to its best
rich exciting blur.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tonight I must smoke or die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Must</em> you, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-<em>nate</em>,&mdash;a, ay must smoke&mdash;a, or <em>daye</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Es ist bestimmt, in Gottes Rath.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell us what you think of the Pierson, child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was awfully nice. Is it your landlady?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-81" class="pagenum" title="81"></a>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;isn&rsquo;t she nice? We think she&rsquo;s extraordinary&mdash;all
things considered. You know we hadn&rsquo;t the least idea
what she was when we came here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;you embarrass me, child, how shall we put
it to her, Jan?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say she&rsquo;s improper?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;she&rsquo;s improper. We hadn&rsquo;t the faintest notion
of it when we came.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How extraordinary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is extraordinary. We&rsquo;re living in an improper house&mdash;the
whole street&rsquo;s improper we&rsquo;re discovering.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How absolutely awful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Now</em> we know why Mother Cosway hinted when we
left her to come here that we wanted to be free for devil&rsquo;s
mirth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How did you find out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Henriette told us; you see she works for the Pierson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did she tell you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;she told us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Six&rdquo;&mdash;laughed Mag, quoting towards Jan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Six,&rdquo; trumpeted Jan &ldquo;and if not six, seven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They both laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In one evening,&rdquo; trumpeted Jan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say are you going to leave?&rdquo; The thought of the
improper street was terrible and horrible; but they might
go right away to some other part of London. <a id="corr-15"></a>Mag answered
instantly but the interval had seemed long and Miriam was
cold with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; we don&rsquo;t see why we should.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam gazed dumbly from one to the other, finding
herself admiring and wondering more than ever at their
independence and strength.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see the woman&rsquo;s so absolutely self-respecting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much more so than we are!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out of doors she&rsquo;s a model of decorum and good style.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ashamed when we meet her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-82" class="pagenum" title="82"></a>
&ldquo;We are. We skip into the gutter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We babble and slink!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indoors she&rsquo;s a perfect landlady. She&rsquo;s been awfully
good to us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A perfect brick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t drink; she&rsquo;s most exquisitely clean. There&rsquo;s
nothing whatever to&mdash;to indicate the er&mdash;nature of her
profession.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Except that she sits at the window.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But she does not tire her hair and look forth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or fifth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Fool.</em>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam giggled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really Miriam she <em>is</em> rather wonderful you know. We
like her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Henriette is devoted to her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so apparently is her husband.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her <em>husband</em>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;she has a husband&mdash;he appears at rare intervals&mdash;and
a little girl at boarding school. She goes to see her but
the child never comes here. She tells us quite frankly that
she wants to keep her out of harm&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How amazing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s extraordinary. She&rsquo;s Eurasian. She was
born in India.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That accounts for a good deal. Eurasians are awful;
they&rsquo;ve got all the faults of both sides.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;East is East and West is West and never the two shall
meet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we like her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So we have decided to ignore her little peccadilloes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s our business. Frankly I can&rsquo;t see
that it has anything whatever to do with us. Do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know; I don&rsquo;t suppose it has really.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What would you do in our place?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know ... I don&rsquo;t believe I should have found
out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-83" class="pagenum" title="83"></a>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you would; but if you had?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I should have been awfully scared.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would have been afraid that the sixth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or the seventh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Might have wandered upstairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; I mean the whole idea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh; the idea....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;London, my dear Miriam, is full of ideas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will go and get the suppe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jan rose; her bright head and grey shoulders went up
above the lamplight, darkening to steady massive outlines,
strongly moving as she padded and fluttered briskly out of
the room.
</p>

<p>
The rich blur of the room free of the troubling talk and
the swift conversational movements of the two, lifted and
was touched with a faint grey, a suggestion of dawn or
twilight, as if coming from the hidden windows. Mag sat
motionless in her chair, gazing into the fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;... Wise and happy infant, I want to ask your
opinion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam roused herself and glanced steadily across. The
outlines of things grew sharp. She could imagine the room
in daylight and felt a faint sharp sinking; hungry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to state you a case. I think you have an
extraordinarily sharp sense of right and wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh <em>no</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have an extraordinarily sharp sense of right and
wrong. Imagine a woman. Can you imagine a woman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Imagine a woman engaged to a man. Imagine her
allowing&mdash;another man&mdash;to kiss her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam sat thinking. She imagined the two, the snatched
caress, the other man alone and unconscious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you call that treachery to the other person?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would depend upon which she liked best.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the difficulty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Oh.</em> That&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-84" class="pagenum" title="84"></a>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think a kiss, just a kiss&mdash;might be,&mdash;well&mdash;neither
here nor there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s nothing, there&rsquo;s nothing in the whole thing.
If there <em>is</em> anything&mdash;you can&rsquo;t talk about just kisses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dreadful Miriam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you believe in blunted sensibilities?&rdquo; How funny
that Mag should have led up to that new phrase ... but
this was a case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whether if a sensibility is blunted it can ever grow
sharp again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I suppose that&rsquo;s it. How can it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not sure. It&rsquo;s a perfectly awful
idea, I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is awful&mdash;because we are all blunting our sensibilities
all the time&mdash;are we not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it&mdash;whether we ought.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does one always know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so? There&rsquo;s a feeling. Yes I think
one always knows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppe, children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam took her bowl with eager embarrassment ...
the sugar-basin, the pudding basin and the slop bowl
together on a tray, the quickly produced soup&mdash;the wonderful
rich life the girls lived in their glowing rooms&mdash;each room
with a different glow.... Jan&rsquo;s narrow green clean room
with its suite and hair brushes and cosmetics and pictures
of Christ, Mag&rsquo;s crowded shadowy little square, its litter
and its many photographs, their eiderdowns and baths and
hot water bottles; the kitchen alive with eyes and foreheads&mdash;musicians,
artists philosophers pasted on the walls
... why? Why?... Jan with wonderful easy knowledge
of the world&rsquo;s great people ... and strange curious intimate
liking for them ... the sad separate effect of all those
engraved faces ... the perfectly beautiful blur they
made all together in patches on the walls ... the sitting
room, Mag, nearly all Mag, except the photographs on
<a id="page-85" class="pagenum" title="85"></a>
the mantelpiece ... the whole rooms from the top of the
stairs ... her thoughts folded down; they were not going
away; not; that was certain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say I can&rsquo;t go on for ever eating your soup.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Drink</em> it then for a change my child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No but really.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is special soup; there is a charge; one guinea
a basin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Use of room two guineas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Intellectual conversation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One and eleven three.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam flung out delighted admiring glances and laughed
unrestrainedly. Mag&rsquo;s look saying &ldquo;it does not take much
to keep the child amused&rdquo; took nothing from her mirthful
joy. Their wit, or was it humour?&mdash;always brought the
same happy shock ... they were so funny; there was a
secret in it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good soup.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Desiccated&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A penny a packet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thickened with pea flour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Twopence a packet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;Was she your favourite schoolfellow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam&rsquo;s jarred mind worked eagerly. The girls thought
this was a revival of some great school friendship ...
they would not be in the least jealous; they were curious
and interested, but they must understand ... they must
realise that Alma was wonderful ... something to be
proud of ... in the strange difficult scientific way; something
they knew hardly anything about. Mag almost not at
all and Jan only in a general way in her neat wide education;
but not in Alma&rsquo;s way of being rigid and reverent and
personally interested about, so that every other way of
looking at things made her angry. But they must understand,
they must in some quite certain way be quickly made
<a id="page-86" class="pagenum" title="86"></a>
to understand at the same time that she was outside ...
an extra ... a curious bright distant resource, nothing
whatever to do with the wonderful present ... the
London life was sacred and secret, away from everything
else in the world. It would disappear if one had ties outside
... anything besides the things of holidays and week-ends
that they all three had and brought back from outside
to talk about. It would be easy and exciting to meet Alma
if that were clear, and to come back and tell the girls
about it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They both looked up, stirring in their quick way, and
waited.
</p>

<p>
Miriam moved her head uneasily. It was painful. They
were using a sort of language ... that was the trouble
... your favourite flower ... your favourite colour ...
it was just the sort of pain that came in trying to fill up
confession albums. This bit of conversation would be at
an end presently. Her anger would shut it up, and they
would put it away without understanding and Mag would
go on to something else.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think she was. She was very small and
pretty&mdash;petite. She had the most wonderful limpid eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mag was sitting forward with her elbows on her knees
and her little hands sticking out into the air. A comfortable
tinkling chuckle shook her shoulders. Miriam tugged
and wrenched.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she cared for me, really ... she was an
only child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mag&rsquo;s chuckle pealed up into a little festoon of clear
laughter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t care for you because&mdash;she&rsquo;s&mdash;an&mdash;only&mdash;child&rdquo;
she shook out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of the sheltered ones.&rdquo; Jan returned to her
chiffon pleats. She was making conversation. She did
not care how much or how little Alma mattered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s sheltered now anyhow&mdash;she&rsquo;s married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-87" class="pagenum" title="87"></a>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;she&rsquo;s married....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s married is she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Polite tones ... they were not a bit surprised ... both
faces looked calm and abstracted. The room was dark
and clear in the cold entanglement. It must be got over
now, as if she had not mentioned Alma. She felt for her
packet of cigarettes with an uneasy face, watching Mag&rsquo;s
firm movements as she rearranged herself and her dressing
gown in her chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About my age.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;about nine; that&rsquo;s early to begin the sheltered
life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t begin the sheltered life too early; if you
are going to begin it at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why begin it at all, Jan?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well my dear little Miriam I think there is a good
deal to be said for the sheltered life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Mag settled more deeply into her chair,
burrowing with her shoulders and crossing her knees with
a fling&mdash;&ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t begin it jolly early it&rsquo;s too late
to begin it at all....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Mag meant to stay always as she was ... oh, good,
good ... with several people interested in her ... what
a curious worry her engagement must be ... irrelevant
... and with her ideas of loyalty. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think soh?&rdquo;
Irritating&mdash;why did she do it&mdash;what was it&mdash;not a provincialism&mdash;some
kind of affectation as if she were on the
stage. It sounded brisk and important&mdash;soh&mdash;as if her
thoughts had gone on and she was making conversation
with her lips. Why not let them and drop it ... there
was something waiting, always something waiting just outside
the nag of conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine anything more awful than what you
call the sheltered life&rdquo; said Miriam with a little pain in
her forehead. Perhaps they would laugh and that would
finish it and something would begin.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-88" class="pagenum" title="88"></a>
&ldquo;For us yes. Imagine either of us coming down to it
in the morning; the regular breakfast table, the steaming
coffee, the dashes of rishers ... dishers of rashes I mean,
the eggs....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are alluding I presume to the beggs and acon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely. We should die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of boredom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Imagine not being able to turn up on Sunday morning
in your knickers with your hair down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I love Sundays. That first cigarette over the <em>Referee</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is like nothing on earth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or in heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, or in heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The first cigarette anyhow, with or without the <em>Referee</em>.
It&rsquo;s just pure absolute bliss that first bit of Sunday morning;
complete well-being and happiness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;While the sheltered people are flushed with breakfast
table-talk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or awkward silences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The deep damned silence of disillusionment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And thinking about getting ready for church.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The men smoke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stealthily and sleepily in armchairs like cats&mdash;ever seen
a cat smoke?&mdash;like cats&mdash;with the wife or somebody they
are tired of talking to on the doormat&mdash;as it were&mdash;tentatively,
I speak <em>ten</em>tatively ... in a dead-alley&mdash;Dedale&mdash;Dedalus&mdash;coming
into the room any minute in Sunday
clothes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To stand on the hearthrug.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No hanging about the room. If there&rsquo;s any hearthrug
standing it&rsquo;s the men who do it, smoking blissfully alone,
and trying to look weary and wise and important if anyone
comes in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like Cabinet ministers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; when they are really&mdash;er.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cabinets.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Footstools; office stools; you never saw a sheltered
<a id="page-89" class="pagenum" title="89"></a>
woman venture on to the hearthrug except for a second if
she&rsquo;s short-sighted to look at the clock.&rdquo; Miriam sprang
to the hearthrug and waved her cigarette. &ldquo;Con-fu-sion
to the sheltered life!&rdquo; The vast open of London swung,
welcoming, before her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hoch! Hoch!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Banzai!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We certainly have our compensations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Com-pen-<em>sa</em>-tions?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;for all the things we have to give up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The things that belong to us. To our youth. Tennis,
dancing&mdash;er irresponsibility in general....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never once thought about any of those things;
never once since I came to town&rdquo; said Miriam grappling
with little anxious pangs that assailed her suddenly; dimly
seeing the light on garden trees, hearing distant shouts,
the sound of rowlocks, the lapping of water against smoothing
swinging sculls. But all that life meant people, daily
association with sheltered women and complacent abominable
men, there half the time and half the time away on
their own affairs which gave them a sort of mean advantage,
and money. There was nothing really to regret. It was
different for Mag. She did not mind ordinary women.
Did not know the difference; or men.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes but anyhow. If we were in the sheltered life we
should either have done with that sort of thing and be
married&mdash;or still keeping it up and anxious about not being
married. Besides anyhow; <a id="corr-16"></a>think of the awful <em>people</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Intolerant child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she intolerant. What a good thing you met us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes of course; but I&rsquo;m not intolerant. And look
here. Heaps of those women envy us. They envy us our
freedom. What we&rsquo;re having is wanderyahre; the next
best thing to wanderyahre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t want wanderyahre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do, Jan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-90" class="pagenum" title="90"></a>
&ldquo;So do I. I think the child&rsquo;s quite right there. Freedom
is life. We may be slaves all day and guttersnipes all the
rest of the time but ach Gott, we are free.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;What a perfectly extraordinary idea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know. But I don&rsquo;t see how you can get away from
it&rdquo; mused Miriam, dreamily holding out against Jan&rsquo;s
absorbed sewing and avoiding for a moment Mag&rsquo;s incredulously
speculative eyes; &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she went on,
the rich blur of the warm room becoming as she sent out
her voice evenly, thinking eagerly on, a cool clear even
daylight, &ldquo;that everything that can possibly happen does
happen, then there must be somewhere in the world, every
possible kind of variation of us and this room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say&rdquo; gurgled Mag with a fling of her
knickered leg and an argumentative movement of the hand
that hung loosely dangling a cigarette over the fireside arm
of the chair, &ldquo;that there are millions of rooms exactly like
this each with one thing different&mdash;say the stem of one
narcissus broken instead of whole for instance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Miriam, infinitude couldn&rsquo;t hold them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Infinitude can hold anything&mdash;of course I can see the
impossibility of a single world holding all the possible
variations of everything at once&mdash;but what I mean is that
I can think it and there must be something corresponding
to it in life&mdash;anything that the mind can conceive is realised,
somehow, all possibilities must come about, that&rsquo;s what I
mean I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean you can see, as it were in space, millions of
little rooms&mdash;a little different&rdquo; choked Mag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes I can&mdash;quite distinctly&mdash;solid&mdash;no end to them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a perfectly horrible idea&rdquo; stated Jan complacently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t&mdash;I love it and it&rsquo;s true ... you go on and
on and on, filling space.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then space is solid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-91" class="pagenum" title="91"></a>
&ldquo;It is solid. People who talk of empty space don&rsquo;t
think ... space is more solid than a wall ... yes ...
more solid than a diamond&mdash;girls, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Space is full of glorious stars....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I know but that&rsquo;s such a tiny bit of it....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Millions and trillions of miles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those are only words. Everything is words.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well you <em>must</em> use words.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought not to think in words. I mean&mdash;you can
think in your brain by imagining yourself going on and on
through it, endless space.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t grasp space with your mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <span class="sc">grasp</span> it. You go through it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see what you mean. To me it is a fearful idea. Like
eternal punishment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as eternal punishment. The
idea is too silly. It makes God a failure and a fool. It&rsquo;s
a man&rsquo;s idea. The men who take the hearthrug. Sitting
on a throne judging everybody and passing sentence is a
thing a man would do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But humanity is wicked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then God is. You can&rsquo;t separate God and humanity
and that includes women who don&rsquo;t really believe any of
those things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>But.</em> Look at the churches. Look at women and the
parsons.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Women like ritual and things and they like parsons,
<em>some</em> parsons, because they are like women, penetrable to
light, as Wilberforce said the other day, and understand
women better than most men do.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ourselves. Rising on the ashes of our dead selves.

<p>
&ldquo;So am I. We shall be in bed, Miriam, five minutes

</p>

<p>
Jan went off for the hot water bottles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m going&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Miriam bent for her shoes.
The soles were dry, scorching; they scorched her feet as
she forced on the shoes; one sole cracked across as she put
her foot to the ground ... she braced the muscles of her
face and said nothing. It must be forgotten before she left
<a id="page-93" class="pagenum" title="93"></a>
the room that they were nearly new and her only pair;
two horrid ideas, nagging and keeping things away.

<p class="noindent">
Outside in the air daylight grew strong and clear in
Miriam&rsquo;s mind. Patches of day came in a bright sheen
from the moonlit puddles, distributed over the square.
She crossed the road to the narrow pathway shadowed by
the trees that ran round the long oblong enclosure. From
this dark pathway the brightness of the wet moonlit roadway
was brighter and she could see façades that caught the
moonlight. There was something trying to worry her,
some little thing that did not matter at all, but that some
part of her had put away to worry over and was now wanting
to consider. Mag&rsquo;s affairs ... no she had decided about
that. It might be true about blunted sensibilities; but
she had meant for some reason to let that other man kiss
her, and people never ask advice until they have made up
their minds what they are going to do and Mag was Mag
quite apart from anything that might happen. She would
still be Mag if she were old ... or mad. That was a firm
settled real thing, real and absolute in the daylight of the
moonlit square. She wandered slowly on humming a tune;
every inch of the way would be lovely. The figure of a
man in an overcoat and a bowler hat loomed towards her
on the narrow pathway and stopped. The man raised his
hat, and his face showed smiling with the moonlight on it.
Miriam had a moment&rsquo;s fear; but the man&rsquo;s attitude was
deprecating and there was her song; it was partly her own
fault. But why why ... fierce anger at the recurrence
of this kind of occurrence seized her. She wanted him out
of the way and wanted him to know how angry she was at
the interruption.

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she snapped angrily, coming to a standstill in
the moonlit gap.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; said the man a little breathlessly in a lame broken
tone, &ldquo;I thought you were going this way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-94" class="pagenum" title="94"></a>
&ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; retorted Miriam in a loud angry shaking
tone, &ldquo;obviously.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man stepped quickly into the gutter and walked
quickly away across the road. St. Pancras church chimed
the quarter.
</p>

<p>
Miriam marched angrily forward with shaking limbs that
steadied themselves very quickly ... the night had become
suddenly cold; bitter and penetrating; a north-east wind,
of course. It was frightfully cold after the warm room;
the square was bleak and endless; the many façades were
too far off to keep the wind away; the pavement was very
cold under her right foot; that was it; the broken sole
was the worry that had been trying to come up; she
could walk with it; it would not matter if the weather
kept dry ... an upright gait, hurrying quickly away across
the moonlit sheen; just the one she had summoned up
anger and courage to challenge was not so bad as the
others ... they were not bad; that was not it; it was
the way they got in the way ... figures of men, dark, in
dark clothes, presenting themselves, calling attention to
themselves and the way they saw things, mean and suggestive,
always just when things were loveliest. Couldn&rsquo;t
the man see the look of the square and the moonlight?
... that afternoon at Hyde Park Corner ... just when
everything flashed out after the rain ... the sudden words
close to her ear ... my beauty ... my sweet ... you
sweet girl ... the puffy pale old face, the puffs under the
sharp brown eyes. A strange ... <em>conviction</em> in the trembling
old voice ... it was deliberate; a sort of statement;
done on purpose, something chosen that would
please most. It was like the conviction and statement
there had been in Bob Greville&rsquo;s voice. Old men seemed
to have some sort of understanding of things. If only they
would talk with the same conviction about other things
as there was in their tone when they said those personal
things. But the things they said were worldly&mdash;generalisations,
like the things one read in books that tired you out
<a id="page-95" class="pagenum" title="95"></a>
with trying to find the answer, and made books so awful
... things that might look true about everybody at
some time or other and were not really true about anybody&mdash;when
you knew them. But people liked those things and
thought them clever and smiled about them. All the things
the old men said about life and themselves and other people,
about everything but oneself, were sad; disappointed and
sad with a glint of far off youth in their faces as they said
them ... something moving in the distance behind the
blue of their eyes.... &ldquo;Make the best of your youth my
dear before it flies.&rdquo; If it all ended in sadness and envy of
youth, life was simply a silly trick. <em>Life</em> could not be a
silly trick. Life cannot be a silly trick. That is the simple
truth ... a certainty. Whatever happens, whatever things
look like, life is not a trick.
</p>

<p>
Miriam began singing again when she felt herself in her
own street, clear and empty in the moonlight. The north
wind blew down it unobstructed and she was shivering and
singing ... &ldquo;spring is <em>co</em>-ming a-and the <em>swa</em>-llows&mdash;have
come <em>back</em> to te-ell me <em>so</em>.&rdquo; Spring could not be far off.
At this moment in the dark twilight behind the thick north
wind the squares were green.

Her song, restrained on the doorstep and while she felt
her already well-known way in almost insupportable happiness
through the unlit hall and through the moonlight up
the seventy-five stairs, broke out again when her room was
reached and her door shut; the two other doors had stood
open showing empty moonlit spaces. She was still alone
and unheard on the top floor. Her room was almost warm
after the outside cold. The row of attic and fourth floor
windows visible from her open lattice were in darkness, or
burnished blue with moonlight. Warm blue moonlight
gleamed along the leads sloping down to her ink-black
parapet. The room was white and blue lit, with a sweet
<a id="page-96" class="pagenum" title="96"></a>
morning of moonlight. She had a momentary impulse
towards prayer and glanced at the bed. To get so far and
cast herself on her knees and hide her face in her hands
against the counterpane, the bones behind the softness of
her hands meeting the funny familiar round shape of her
face, the dusty smell of the counterpane coming up, her
face praying to her hands, her hands praying to her face,
both throbbing separately with their secret, would drive
something away. Something that was so close in everything
in the room, so pouring in at the window that she
could scarcely move from where she stood. She flung
herself more deeply into her song and passed through the
fresh buoyant singing air to light the gas. The room
turned to its bright evening brown. <em>Prayer.</em> Being so
weighed down and free with happiness was the time ...
sacrifice ... the evening <em>sacrifice</em> of praise and prayer. That
is what that means. To toss all the joys and happiness
away and know that you are happy and free without anything.
That you cannot escape being happy and free. It
always comes.
</p>

<p>
Why am I so happy and free she wondered with tears
in her eyes. Why? Why do lovely things and people go
on happening? To <em>own</em> that something in you had no
right. But not crouching on your knees ... standing
and singing till everything split with your joy and let you
through into the white white brightness.

To <em>see</em> the earth whirling slowly round, coloured, its
waters catching the light. She stood in the middle of the
floor hurriedly discarding her clothes. They were old and
worn, friendly and alive with the fresh strength of her
body. Other clothes would be got somehow; just by going
on and working ... there&rsquo;s so much&mdash;eternally. It&rsquo;s
stupendous. I&rsquo;ve no right to be in it; but I&rsquo;m in. Someone
means me to be in. <em>I</em> can&rsquo;t help it. Fancy people
<a id="page-97" class="pagenum" title="97"></a>
being alive. You would think everyone would go mad.
She found herself in bed, sitting up in her flannellette
dressing jacket. The stagnant air beneath the sharp downward
slope of the ceiling was warmed by the gas. The gaslight
glared beautifully over her shoulder down on to the

<em>All</em> that has been said and known in the world is in
<em>language</em>, in words; all we know of Christ is in Jewish
words; all the dogmas of religion are words; the meanings
of words change with people&rsquo;s thoughts. Then no
one <em>knows</em> anything for certain. Everything depends upon
the way a thing is put, and that is a question of some
particular civilisation. Culture comes through literature,
which is a half-truth. People who are not cultured are
isolated in barbaric darkness. The Greeks were cultured;
but they are barbarians ... why? Whether you agree or
not, language is the only way of expressing anything and it
dims everything. So the Bible is not true; it is a culture.
Religion is wrong in making word-dogmas out of it. Christ
was something. But Christianity which calls Him divine
and so on is false. It clings to words which get more and
more wrong ... then there&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of and
nothing to be quite sure of rejoicing about. The Christians
are irritating and frightened. The man with side-whiskers
understands something. But.

To sit hearing the very best in the intellectual life of
London, the very best science there was; the inner circle
suddenly open ... the curious quiet happy laughter
that went through the world with the idea of the breaking
up of air and water and rays of light; the strange <em>love</em>
that came suddenly to them all in the object lesson classes
at Banbury Park. That was to begin again ... but now
not only books, not the strange heavenly difficult success
of showing the children the things that had been found
out; but the latest newest things from the men themselves&mdash;there
would be an audience and a happy man with
a lit face talking about things he had just found out. Even
if one did not understand there would be that. Fancy
Mr. Hancock being a member and always going and not

number of things besides the wonders of dentistry and
pottery and Japanese art.

twelve years of education and five months in Germany
and two teaching posts&mdash;to people who could not see how

into her life, and staying until she understood ... somebody
struggled all night with the angel ... I will not let

&ldquo;This is the library&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock leading Miriam
along from the landing at the top of the wide red-carpeted
staircase. It seemed a vast room&mdash;rooms leading one out
of the other, lit with soft red lights and giving a general
effect of redness, dull crimson velvet in a dull red glow and
people, standing in groups and walking about&mdash;a quite
new kind of people. Miriam glanced at her companion.
He looked in place; he was in his right place; these were
his people; people with gentle enlightened faces and keen
enlightened faces. They were all alike in some way. If
the room caught fire there would be no panic. They were
gentle, shyly gentle or pompously gentle, but all the same
and in agreement because they all knew everything, the real
important difficult things. Some of them were discussing
and disagreeing; many of the women&rsquo;s faces had questions
and disagreements on them and they were nearly all worn
with thought; but they would disagree in a way that was
not quarrelsome, because everyone in the room was sure
of the importance of the things they were discussing ...
they were all a part of science.... &ldquo;Science is always right
and the same, religion cannot touch it or be reconciled
with it, theories may modify or cancel each other but the
methods of science are one and unvarying. To question
that fundamental truth is irreligious&rdquo; ... these people
were that in the type of their minds&mdash;one and unvarying;
always looking out at something with gentle intelligence
or keen intelligence ... this was Alma&rsquo;s world ... it
would be something to talk to Alma about. There was
something they were not. They were not ... jolly. They
could not be. They would never stop &ldquo;looking.&rdquo; Culture
and refinement; with something about it that made them
quite different to the worldly people, a touch of rawness,
raw school harshness about them that was unconscious of
itself and could not come to life. Their shoulders and the
backs of their heads could never come to life. It gave them
<a id="page-101" class="pagenum" title="101"></a>
a kind of deadness that was quite unlike the deadness of the
worldly people, not nearly so dreadful&mdash;rather funny and
likable. One could imagine them all washing, very carefully,
in an abstracted way still looking and thinking and
always with the advancement of science on their minds;
never really aware of anything behind or around them
because of the wonders of science. Seeing these people
changed science a little. They were almost something
tremendous; but not quite.

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s old Huggins&rdquo; murmured Mr. Hancock, giving
Miriam&rsquo;s arm a gentle nudge as a white-haired old man
passed close by them with an old woman at his side, with
short white hair exactly like him. &ldquo;The man who invented
spectrum analysis&mdash;and that&rsquo;s his wife; they&rsquo;re both great
fishermen.&rdquo; Miriam gazed. <em>There</em>, was the splendid thing....
In her mind blazed the coloured bars of the spectrum.
In the room was the light of the beauty, the startling <em>life</em>
these two old people shed from every part of their persons.
The room blazed in the light they shed. She stood staring,
moving to watch their gentle living movements. They
moved as though the air through which they moved was a
living medium,&mdash;as though everything were alive all round
them&mdash;in a sort of hushed vitality. They were young.
She felt she had never seen anyone so young. She longed
to confront them just once, to stand for a moment the
tide in which they lived.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Ah</em> Meesturra Hancock&mdash;you <em>are</em> a faceful votary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s a German, thought Miriam, as the flattering deep
caressing gutturals rebounded dreadfully from her startled
consciousness. What a determined intrusion. How did
he come to know such a person? Glancing she met a pair
of swiftly calculating eyes fixed full on her face. There
was fuzzy black hair lifted back from an anxious, yellowish,
preoccupied little face. Under the face came the high
collar-band of a tightly-fitting dark claret-coloured ribbed
<a id="page-102" class="pagenum" title="102"></a>
silk bodice, fastened from the neck to the end of the pointed
peak by a row of small round German buttons, closely
decorated with a gilded pattern. Mr. Hancock was smiling
an indulgent, deprecating smile. He made an introduction
and Miriam felt her hand tightly clasped and held by a
small compelling hand, while she sought for an answer to a
challenge as to her interest in science. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really
know anything about it&rdquo; she said vaguely, strongly urged
to display her knowledge of German. The eyes were
removed from her face and the little lady boldly planted
and gazing about her made announcements to Mr. Hancock&mdash;about
the fascinating subject of the lecture and her hopes
of a large and appreciative audience.
</p>

<p>
What did she want? She could not possibly fail to see
that Mr. Hancock was telling her that he could see through
her social insincerities. It was dreadful to find that even
here there were social insincerities. She was like a busy
ambassador for things that belonged somewhere else and
that he was laughing at in an indulgent, deprecating way
that must make her blaze with an anger that she did not
show. Looking at her as her eyes and mouth made and
fired their busy sentences, Miriam suddenly felt that it
would be easy to deal with her, take her into a corner and
talk about German things, food and love affairs and poetry
and music. But she would always be breaking away to
make a determined intrusion on somebody she knew. She
could not really know any English person. What was she
doing, bearing herself so easily in the inner circle of English
science? Treating people as if she knew all about them
and they were all alike. How surprised she must often be,
and puzzled.

&ldquo;That was Miss Teresa Szigmondy&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock,
reproducing his amused smile as they took their seats in the
dark theatre.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is she German?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-103" class="pagenum" title="103"></a>
&ldquo;Well ... I think, as a matter of fact, she&rsquo;s part
Austro-Hungarian and part&mdash;well, <em>Hebrew</em>.&rdquo; A Jewess ...
Miriam left her surroundings, pondering over a sudden
little thread of memory. An eager, very bright-eyed,
curiously dimpling school-girl face peering into hers, and
a whispering voice&mdash;&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know why we don&rsquo;t go down
to prayers? &rsquo;Cos we&rsquo;re <em>Jews</em>&rdquo;&mdash;they had always been
late; fresh faced and shiny haired and untidy and late
and clever in a strange brisk way and talkative and easy
and popular with the teachers.... Their guttural voices
ringing out about the stairs and passages, deep and loud
and stronger than any of the voices of the other girls. The
Hyamson girls&mdash;they had been foreigners, like the Siggs
and the de Bevers, but different ... what was the difference
in a Jew? Mr. Hancock seemed to think it was a sort of
disgraceful joke ... what was it? Max Sonnenheim
had been a Jew, of course, the same voice. Banbury Park
&ldquo;full of Jews&rdquo; ... the Brooms said that in patient contemptuous
voices. But what <em>was</em> it? What did everybody
mean about them?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is she scientific?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She seems to be interested in science&rdquo; smiled Mr.
Hancock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How funny of her to ask me to go to tea with her just
because you told her I knew German.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you go; if you&rsquo;re interested in seeing notabilities
you&rsquo;ll meet all kinds of wonderful people at her house. She
knows everybody. She&rsquo;s the niece of a great Hungarian
poet. I believe he&rsquo;s to be seen there sometimes. They&rsquo;re
all coming in now.&rdquo; Mr. Hancock named the great names
of science one by one as the shyly gentle and the pompously
gentle little old men ambled and marched into the well
of the theatre and took their seats in a circle round the
central green table.

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;<em>There&rsquo;s</em> a pretty lady&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock, conversationally,
just as the light was lowered. Miriam glanced
<a id="page-104" class="pagenum" title="104"></a>
across the half circle of faintly shining faces and saw an effect,
a smoothly coiffured head and smooth neck and shoulders
draped by a low deep circular flounce of lace rising from
the gloom of a dark dress, sweep in through a side door
bending and swaying&mdash;&ldquo;or a pretty dress at any rate&rdquo;&mdash;and
sat through the first minutes of the lecture, recalling
the bearing and manner of the figure, with sad fierce bitterness.
Mr. Hancock admired &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; women ...
or at any rate he was bored by her own heavy silence and
driven into random speech by the sudden dip and sweep
of the lace appearing in the light of the doorway. He was
surprised himself by his sudden speech and half corrected
it ... &ldquo;or a pretty dress.&rdquo; ... But anyhow he, even he,
was one of those men who do not know that an effect like
that was just an effect, a deliberate &ldquo;charming&rdquo; feminine
effect. But if he did not know that, did not know that it
was a trick and the whole advertising manner, the delicate,
plunging fall of the feet down the steps&mdash;&ldquo;I am late;
look how nicely and quietly I am doing it; look at me
being late and apologetic and interested&rdquo;&mdash;out of place
in the circumstances; then what was he doing here at all?
Did he <em>want</em> science or would he really rather be in a drawing
room with &ldquo;pretty ladies&rdquo; advertising effects and being
&ldquo;arch&rdquo; in a polite, dignified, lady-like manner? How
dingy and dull and unromantic and unfeminine he must
find her. She sat in a lively misery, following the whirling
circle of thoughts round and round, stabbed by their dull
thorns, and trying to drag her pain-darkened mind to meet
the claim of the platform, where, in a square of clear light,
a little figure stood talking eagerly and quietly in careful
slow English. Presently the voice on the platform won
her&mdash;clear and with its curious, even, unaccented rat-tat-tat
flowing and modulated with pure passion, the thrill of
truth and revelation running alive and life-giving through
every word. That, at least, she was sharing with her
companion ... &ldquo;development-in-thee-method-of-intaircepting-thee-light.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Daguerre&rdquo; ... a little Frenchman stopping
<a id="page-105" class="pagenum" title="105"></a>
the sunlight, breaking it up, making it paint faces in filmy
black and white on a glass.... There would only be a
few women like the one with the frill in an audience like
this ... &ldquo;women will talk shamelessly at a concert or an
opera, and chatter on a mountain top in the presence of a
magnificent panorama; their paganism is incurable.&rdquo;
Then men mustn&rsquo;t stare at them and treat them as works
of art. It was entirely the fault of men ... perfectly
reasonable that the women who got that sort of admiration
from men should assert themselves in the presence of other
works of art. The thing men called the noblest work of
God must be bigger than the work by a man. Men plumed
themselves and talked in a clever expert way about women
and never thought of their own share in the way those
women went on ... unfair, unfair; men were stupid
complacent idiots. But they were wonderful with their
brains. The life and air and fresh breath coming up from
the platform amongst the miseries and uncertainties lurking
in the audience was a man ... waves of light which would
rush through the film at an enormous speed and get away
into space without leaving any impression were stopped
by some special kind of film and went surging up and down
in confinement&mdash;making strata ... supairposeetion of
strata ... no Englishman could move his hands with that
smoothness, making you see. &ldquo;Violet subchloride of silver.&rdquo;
That would interest Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s chemistry. She glanced
at the figure sitting very still, with bent head, at her side.
He was asleep. Her thoughts recoiled from the platform
and bent inwards, circling on their miseries. That was the
end, for him, of coming to a lecture, with her. If she had
been the frilled lady, sitting forward with her forward-falling
frill, patronising the lecture and &ldquo;exhibiting&rdquo; her
interest he would not have gone to sleep.

<p class="noindent">
When the colour photographs came, Miriam was too
happy for thought. Pictures of stained glass, hard crude
<a id="page-106" class="pagenum" title="106"></a>
clear brilliant opaque flat colour, stood in miraculous
squares on the screen and pieces of gardens, grass and
flowers and trees shining with a shadeless blinding brilliance.
</p>

<p>
She made vague sounds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful achievement&rdquo;
said Mr. Hancock, smiling with grave delighted
approval towards the screen. Miriam felt that he understood,
as her ignorance could not do, exactly what it all
meant scientifically; but there was something else in the
things as they stood, blinding, there that he did not see.
It was something that she had seen somewhere, often.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never touch pictures.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;there&rsquo;s no atmosphere; but there&rsquo;s something
else; they&rsquo;re exactly like something else....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock laughed, a little final crushing laugh that
turned away sceptical of further enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
Miriam sat silent, busily searching for something to
express the effect she felt. But she could not tell him what
she felt. There was something in this intense hard rich
colour like something one sometimes <em>saw</em> when it wasn&rsquo;t
there, a sudden brightening and brightening of all colours
till you felt something must break if they grew any brighter&mdash;or
in the dark, or in one&rsquo;s mind, suddenly, at any time,
unearthly brilliance. He would laugh and think one a little
insane; but it was the real certain thing; the one real
certain happy thing. And he would not have patience to
hear her try to explain; and by that he robbed her of
the power of trying to explain. He was not interested in
what she thought. Not interested. His own thoughts
were statements, things that had been agreed upon and
disputed and that people bandied about, competing with
each other to put them cleverly. They were not <em>things</em>.
It was only by pretending to be interested in these statements
and taking sides about them that she could have
conversation with him. He liked women who thought in
these statements. They always succeeded with men. They
had a reputation for wit. Did they really think and take an
interest in the things they said, or was it a trick, like
<a id="page-107" class="pagenum" title="107"></a>
&ldquo;clothes&rdquo; and &ldquo;manners&rdquo;&mdash;or was it that women brought
up with brothers or living with husbands got into that way
of thinking and speaking. Perhaps there was something
in it. Something worth cultivating; a fine talent. But
it would mean hiding so much, letting so much go; all
the real things. The things men never seemed to know
about at all. Yet he loved beautiful things; and worried
about religion and had found comfort in &ldquo;Literature and
Dogma&rdquo; and wanted her to find comfort in it, assuming
her difficulties were the same as his own; and knowing
the dreadfulness of them. The brilliant unearthly pictures
remained in her mind, supporting her through the trial of
her consciousness of the stuffiness of her one long-worn
dress. Dresses should be fragrant in the evening. The
Newlands evening dress was too old fashioned. Things
had changed so utterly since last year. There was no money
to have it altered. But this was awful. Never again could
she go out in the evening, unless alone or with the girls.
That would be best, and happiest, really.

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">iriam</span> sat on a damp wooden seat at the station.
Shivering with exhaustion, she looked across at the
early morning distance, misty black and faint misty green....
Something had happened to it. It was not beautiful;
or anything. It was not anything.... That was the
punishment.... The landscape was dead. All that had
come to an end. Her nimble lifeless mind noted the fact.
There was dismay in it. Staring at the landscape she felt
the lifelessness of her face; as if something had brushed
across it and swept the life away, leaving her only sight.
She could never feel any more.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Behind her fixed eyes something new seemed moving
forward with a strange indifference. Suddenly the landscape
unrolled. The rim of the horizon was no longer
the edge of the world. She lost sight of it in the rolling
out of the landscape in her mind, out and out, in a
light easy stretch, showing towns and open country and
towns again, seas and continents on and on; empty and
still. <em>No</em>thing. Everywhere in the world nothing. She
drifted back to herself and clung, bracing herself. She was
somebody. If she was somebody who was going to do something
... not roll trolleys along a platform. The train
swept busily into the landscape; the black engine, the
brown, white-panelled carriages, warm and alive in the
empty landscape. Her strained nerves relaxed. In a
moment she would be inside it, being carried back into her
own world. She felt eagerly forward towards it. Hearts-ease
<a id="page-109" class="pagenum" title="109"></a>
was there. She would be able to breathe again. But
not in the same way; unless she could forget. There were
other eyes looking at it. They were inside her; not caring
for the things she had cared for, dragging her away from
them.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
They are not my sort of people. Alma does not
care for me personally. Little cries and excitement and
affection. She wants to; but she does not care for anyone
personally. Neither of them do. They live in a world....
&ldquo;Michael Angelo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stevenson&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hardy&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Dürer&rdquo; and that other man, ... Alma ...
popping and sweeping gracefully about with little cries
and clever sayings and laughter, trying to be real; in a
bright outside way, showing all the inside things because
she kept crushing them down. It was so tiring that one
could not like being with her. She seemed to be carrying
something off all the time; and to be as if she were afraid
if the talk stopped for a moment, it would be revealed.
</p>

<p>
In the teashop with Alma alone it had been different;
all the old school-days coming back as she sat there. Her
eager story. It was impossible to do anything but hold
her hands and admire her bravery and say you did not care.
But it was not quite real; it was too excited and it was
wrong, certainly wrong, to go down not really caring. I
need not go down again.

<p class="noindent">
Cold and torpid she got up and stepped into an empty
carriage. Both windows were shut and the dry stuffy air
seemed almost warm after her exposure. She let one down
a little; sheltered from the damp the little stream of outside
air was welcome and refreshing. She breathed deeply,
safe, shut in and moving on. With an unnecessarily vigorous
swing of her arms she hoisted her pilgrim basket on to the
rack. Of <em>course</em>, she murmured smiling, of <em>course</em> I shall
go down again ... <em>rather</em>.

<p class="noindent">
That extraordinary ending of fear of the great man at
the station. Alma and the little fair square man not much
taller than herself looking like a grocer&rsquo;s assistant with a
curious kind confidential ... unprejudiced eye ... they
had come, both of them, out of their house to the station
to meet her ... &ldquo;this is Hypo&rdquo; and the quiet shy walk
to the house he asking questions by saying them&mdash;statements.
You caught the elusive three-fifteen. This is
your bag. We can carry it off without waiting for the ...
British porter. You&rsquo;ve done your journey brilliantly. We
haven&rsquo;t far to walk.

<p class="noindent">
The strange shock of the bedroom, the strange new thing
springing out from it ... the clear soft bright tones, the
bright white light streaming through the clear muslin, the
freshness of the walls ... the flattened dumpy shapes of
dark green bedroom crockery gleaming in a corner; the
little green bowl standing in the middle of the white spread
of the dressing table cover ... wild violets with green
leaves and tendrils put there by somebody with each leaf
and blossom standing separate ... touching your heart;
joy, looking from the speaking pale mauve little flowers to
the curved rim of the green bowl and away to the green
crockery in the corner; again and again the fresh shock
of the violets ... the little cold change in the room after
the books, strange fresh bindings and fascinating odd shapes
and sizes, gave out their names ... The White Boat&mdash;Praxiter&mdash;King
Chance&mdash;Mrs. Prendergast&rsquo;s Palings ...
the promise of them in their tilted wooden case by the bedside
table from every part of the room, their unchanged
names, the chill of the strange sentences inside&mdash;like a sort
of code written for people who understood, written at
something, clever raised voices in a cold world. In Mrs.
Prendergast&rsquo;s Palings there were cockney conversations spelt
<a id="page-111" class="pagenum" title="111"></a>
as they were spoken. None of the books were about ordinary
people ... three men, seamen, alone, getting swamped in a
boat in shallow water in sight of land ... a man and a
girl he had no right to be with wandering on the sands,
the cold wash and sob of the sea; her sudden cold salt
tears; the warmth of her shuddering body. Praxiter
beginning without telling you anything, about the thoughts
of an irritating contemptuous superior man, talking at the
expense of everybody. Nothing in any of them about
anything one knew or felt; casting you off ... giving a
chill ache to the room. To sit ... alone, reading in the
white light, amongst the fresh colours&mdash;but not these books.
To go downstairs was a sacrifice: coming back there
would be the lighting of the copper candlestick, twisting
beautifully up from its stout stem. What made it different
to ordinary candlesticks? <em>What?</em> It was like ... a gesture.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-6-5">

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;You knew Susan at school.&rdquo; The brown, tweed-covered
arm of the little square figure handed a tea-cup.
The high huskily hooting voice ... what was the overwhelming
impression? A common voice, with a cockney
twang. Overwhelming. &ldquo;What was Susan like at school?&rdquo;
The voice was saying two things; that was it; doing
something deliberately; it was shy and determined and
deliberate and expectant. Miriam glanced incredulously,
summoning all her forces against her sense of strange direct
attack, pushing through and out to some unknown place,
dreading her first words, not taking in a further remark
of the live voice. She could get up and go away for ever;
or speak and whatever she spoke would keep her there
for ever. Alma, sitting behind the tea-tray in a green Alma
dress with small muslin cuffs and collars had betrayed her
into this. Alma had been got by this and had brought her
to the test of it. The brown walls, brown paper all over,
like parcel paper and Japanese prints; nothing else, high-backed
<a id="page-112" class="pagenum" title="112"></a>
curious shaped wooden chairs all with gestures, like
the candlestick, and the voice that was in the same difficult,
different world as the books upstairs.... Alma had betrayed
her, talking as if they were like other people and not
saying anything about this strange cold difference. Alma
had come to it and was playing some part she had taken
up ... there was some wrong hurried rush somewhere
within the beautiful room. Stop, she wanted to say, you&rsquo;re
all wrong. You&rsquo;ve dropped something you don&rsquo;t know
anything about deliberately. Alma ought to have told
you. Hasn&rsquo;t she told you?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alma hasn&rsquo;t changed&rdquo; she said, desperately questioning
the smooth soft movements of the smooth soft hands, the
quiet controlled pose of the head. Alma had the same
birdlike wide blink and flash of her limpid brown eyes, the
same tight crinkle and snicker when she laughed, the same
way of saying nothing or only the clever superficially true
things men said. Alma had agreed with this man and had
told him nothing or only things in the clever way he would
admire.
</p>

<p>
He made little sounds into his handkerchief. He was
nonplussed at a dull answer. It would be necessary to be
brilliant and amusing to hold his attention&mdash;in fact to tell
lies. To get on here one would have to say clever things
in a high bright voice.
</p>

<p>
The little man began making statements about Alma.
Sitting back in his high-backed chair with his head bent
and his small fine hands clasping his large handkerchief he
made little short statements, each improving on the one
before it and coming out of it, and little subdued snortings
at the back of his nose in the pauses between his sentences
as if he were afraid of being answered or interrupted before
he developed the next thing. Alma accompanied his discourse
with increasing snickerings. Miriam after eagerly
watching the curious mouthing half hidden by the drooping
straggle of moustache and the strange concentrated
gleam of the grey blue eyes staring into space, laughed
<a id="page-113" class="pagenum" title="113"></a>
outright. But how could he speak so of her? He met the
laughter with a minatory outstretched forefinger, and raised
his voice to a soft squeal ending as he launched with a little
throw of the hand his final jest, in a rotund crackle of high
hysterical open-mouthed laughter. The door opened and
two tall people were shown in; a woman with a narrow
figure and a long dark-curtained sallow horse-like face,
dressed in a black striped cream serge coat and skirt and a
fair florid troubled fickle smiling man in a Norfolk tweed
and pale blue tie. &ldquo;Hullo&rdquo; said the little man propelling
himself out of his chair with a neat swift gesture and standing
small and square in the room making cordial sounds and
moving his arms about as if to introduce and seat his guests
without words and formalities. Alma&rsquo;s thin excited hubbub
and the clearly enunciated, obviously prepared facetiousnesses
of the newcomers&mdash;his large and tenor and florid
... a less clever man than Mr. Wilson ... and hers bass
and crisp and contemptuous ... nothing was hidden from
her; she would <em>like</em> the queer odd people who went about
at Tansley Street&mdash;was broken into by the entry of three
small young men, all three dark and a little grubby and
shabby looking. The foremost stood with vivid eager eyes
wide open as if he had been suddenly checked in the midst
of imparting an important piece of news. Alma came
forward to where they stood herded and silent just inside
the door and made little faint encouraging maternal sounds
at them as she shook hands.
</p>

<p>
As she did this Miriam figured them in a flash coming
down the road to the house; their young men&rsquo;s talk and
arguments, their certainty of rightness and completeness,
their sudden embarrassment and secret anger with their
precipitate rescuer. Mr. Wilson was on his feet again, not
looking at them nor breaking up the circle already made,
but again making his sociable sounds and circular movements
with his arms as if to introduce and distribute them
about the room. The husband and wife kept on a dialogue
in strained social voices as if they were bent on showing
<a id="page-114" class="pagenum" title="114"></a>
that their performance was not dependant on an audience.
Miriam averted her eyes from them, overcome by painful
visions of the two at breakfast or going home after social
occasions. The three young men retreated to the window
alcove behind the tea-table one of them becoming Miriam&rsquo;s
neighbour as she sat in the corner near the piano whither
she had fled from the centre of the room when the husband
and wife came in.
</p>

<p>
It was the young man with the important piece of news.
He sat bent forward holding his cup and plate with outstretched
arms. His headlong expression remained unchanged.
Wisps of black hair stood eagerly out from his
head and a heavy thatch fell nearly to his eyebrows. &ldquo;Did
anybody see anything of Mrs. Binks at the station?&rdquo; asked
Alma from her table. &ldquo;Oh my dear&rdquo; she squealed gently
as the maid ushered in a little lady in a straight dress of red
flannel frilled with black chiffon at the neck and wrists,
&ldquo;we were all afraid you weren&rsquo;t coming.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t anybody
move&rdquo;&mdash;the deep reedy voice reverberated amongst
the standing figures; the firm compact undulating figure
came across the room to Alma. Its light-footed swiftness
and easy certainty filled Miriam with envy. The envy
evaporated during the embracing of Alma and the general
handshaking. The low strong reedy voice went on saying
things out into the silence of the room in a steady complete
way. There was something behind it all that did not show,
or showed in the brilliant ease, something that Miriam did
not envy. She tried to discover what it was as the room
settled, leaving Mrs. Binkley on a low chair near to Alma,
taking tea and going on with her monologue, each of her
pauses punctuated by soft appreciative sounds from Alma
and little sounds from Mr. Wilson. She was popular with
them. Mr. Wilson sat surveying her. Did they know how
hard she was working? Perhaps they did and admired
or even envied it. But what was it for? Surely she must
feel the opposition in the room? Alma and Mr. Wilson
approved and encouraged her exhibition. She was in their
<a id="page-115" class="pagenum" title="115"></a>
curious league for keeping going high-voiced clever sayings.
So had the husband appeared to be at first. Now he sat
silent with a kind polite expression about his head and figure.
But his mouth was uneasy, he was afraid of something or
somebody and was staring at Mrs. Binkley. The wife sat
in a gloomy abstraction smoking a large cigarette ...
she was something like Mrs. Kronen in her way; only
instead of belonging to South Africa she had been a hard
featured English school-girl; she was still a hard-featured
English school-girl, with the oldest eyes Miriam had ever
seen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not write an article about a lamp-post?&rdquo; said
one of the young men suddenly in a gruff voice in answer
to a gradually growing murmur of communications from
one of his companions. Miriam breathed easier air. The
shameful irritating tension was over. It was as if fresh
wonderful life-giving things that were hovering in the
room, driven back into corners, pressing up and away
against the angles of the ceiling and about the window-door
behind the young men and against the far-away door
of the room, came back, flooding all the spaces of the room.
Mr. Wilson moved in his chair, using his handkerchief
towards the young men with an eye on the speaker. &ldquo;Or
a whole book&rdquo; murmured the young man farthest from
Miriam in an eager cockney voice. The two young men
were speaking towards Mr. Wilson, obviously trying to draw
him in, bringing along one of his topics; something that
had been discussed here before. There would be talk,
men&rsquo;s talk, argument and showing off; but there would
be something alive in the room. In the conflict there would
be ideas, wrong ideas, men taking sides, both right and both
wrong; men showing off; but wanting with all their
wrongness to get at something. Perhaps somebody would
say something. She regretted her shy refusal of a cigarette
from Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s large full box. It stood open now by
the side of the tea-tray. He would not offer it again.
Cigarettes and talk.... What would Mr. Hancock think?
<a id="page-116" class="pagenum" title="116"></a>
&ldquo;People do not meet together for conversation, nowadays.&rdquo; ...
There was going to be conversation, literary
conversation and she was going to hear it ... be in it.
Clever literary people trying to say things well; of course
they were all literary; they were all the same set, knowing
each other, all calling Mr. Wilson &ldquo;Hypo&rdquo;; talk about
books was the usual Saturday afternoon thing here; and
she was in it and would be able to be in it again, any week.
It was miraculous. All these people were special people,
emancipated people. Probably they all wrote, except the
women. There were too many women. Somehow or other
she must get a cigarette. Life, suddenly full of new things
made her bold. Presently, when the conversation was
general she would beg one of the young man at her side.
Mr. Wilson would not turn to her again. She had failed
twice already in relation to him; but after her lame
refusal of the cigarette which he had accepted instantly
and sat down with, he had glanced sharply at her in a
curious personal way, noticing the little flat square of white
collarette&mdash;the knot of violets upon it, the long-sleeved
black nun&rsquo;s-veiling blouse, the long skirt of her old silkette
evening dress. These items had made her sick with anxiety
in their separate poverty as she put them on for the visit;
but his eyes seemed to draw them all together. Perhaps
there in the dark corner they made a sort of whole. She
rejoiced gratefully in the memory of Mag&rsquo;s factory girl,
in her own idea of having the sleeves gauged at the wrists
in defiance of fashion, to make frills extending so as partly
to cover her large hands; over the suddenly realised possibility
of wearing the silkette skirt as a day skirt. She must
remain in the corner, not moving, all the afternoon. If
she moved in the room the bright light would show the
scrappiness of her clothes. In the evening it would be all
right. She sat back in her corner, happy, and forgetful.
She had not had so much tea as she wanted. She had
refused the cigarette against her will. Now she was alive.
These weak things would not happen again, and next time
<a id="page-117" class="pagenum" title="117"></a>
she would bring her own cigarettes. To take out a cigarette
and light it here, at home amongst her own people. These
were her people. There was something here in the exciting
air that she did not understand; something that was going
to tax her more than she had ever been taxed before. She
had found her way to it through her wanderings; it had
come; it was her due. It corresponded to something in
herself, shapeless and inexpressible; but there. She knew
it by herself, sitting in her corner; her own people would
know it, if they could see her here; but no one here would
find it out. Every one here was doing something; or the
wife of somebody who did something. They were like a
sort of secret society ... all agreed about something ...
about what? <em>What</em> was it Mr. Wilson was so sure about?...
They would despise everybody who was living an ordinary
life, or earning a living in anything but something to do
with books. Seeing her there they would take for granted
that she too, was somebody ... and she was somehow,
within herself somewhere; although she had made herself
into a dentist&rsquo;s secretary. She was better qualified to
be here and to understand the strange secret here, in the
end, than anyone else she knew. But it was a false position,
unless they all <a id="corr-20"></a>knew what she was. If she could say clever
things they would like her; but she would be like Alma
and Mrs. Binkley; pretending; and without any man
to point to as giving her the right to be about here. It was
a false position. It was as if she were there as a candidate
to become an Alma or a Mrs. Binkley; imitating the
clever sayings of men, or flattering them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Do</em> it Gowry,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilson ... &ldquo;a book&rdquo; ...
he made his little sound behind his nose as he felt for the
phrases that were to come after his next words ... &ldquo;a&mdash;er&mdash;book;
about a lamp-post. You see&rdquo; he held up
his minatory finger to keep off an onslaught and quench
an eager monologue that began pouring from Miriam&rsquo;s
nearest neighbour, and went on in his high weak husky
voice. <a id="corr-21"></a>The young men were quiet. For a few moments
<a id="page-118" class="pagenum" title="118"></a>
the red lady and Alma made bright conversation as if
nothing were happening; but with a curious hard emptiness
in their voices, like people rehearsing and secretly angry
with each other. Then they were silent, sitting posed and
attentive, with uneasy intelligent smiling faces; their
costumes and carefully arranged hair useless on their hands.
Mrs. Binkley did not suffer so much as Alma; her corsetless
eager crouch gave her the appearance of intentness,
her hair waved naturally, had tendrils and could be left
to look after itself; her fresh easy strength was ready for
the next opportunity. It was only something behind her
face that belied her happy pose. Alma was waiting in some
curious fixed singleness of tension; her responses hovered
fixed about her mouth, waiting for expression, she sat fixed
in a frozen suspension of deliberate amiability and approval,
approval of a certain chosen set of things; approval which
excluded everything else with derision ... it was Alma&rsquo;s
old derision, fixed and arranged in some way by Mr. Wilson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There will be books&mdash;with all that cut out&mdash;him and
her&mdash;all that sort of thing. The books of the future will
be clear of all that.&rdquo;

<p class="noindent">
Miriam sat so enclosed in her unarmed struggle with the
new definition of a book that the entry of the newcomers
left her unembarrassed. Two rotund ruddy men in mud-spotted
tweeds, both fair, one with a tuft like a cockatoo
standing straight up from his forehead above a smooth
pink face, the other older than anybody in the room, with
a shaggy head and a small pointed beard. They came
in talking aloud and stumped about the room, making
their greetings. Miriam bowed twice and twice received
a sturdy handclasp and the kindly gleam of blue eyes, one
pair large, mild and owl-like behind glasses; the other
fierce and glinting, a shaft of whimsical blue light. The
second pair of eyes surely would not agree with what Mr.
<a id="page-119" class="pagenum" title="119"></a>
Wilson had been saying. But their coming in had broken
a charm; the overwhelming charm of the way he put
things; so that even while you hated what he was saying
and his way of stating things as if they were the final gospel
and no one else in the world knew anything at all, you wanted
him to go on; only to go on and to keep on going on. It
was wrong somehow; he was all wrong; &ldquo;though I speak
with the tongues of men and of angels&rdquo;; it was wrong
and somehow wicked; but it caught you, it had caught
Alma and all these people; and in a sense he despised them
all, and was talking to something else; the thing he knew;
the secret that made him so strong, even with his weak
voice and weak mouth; strong and fascinating. It was
wrong to be here; it would be wrong to come again; but
there was nothing like it anywhere else; no other such
group of things; and thought and knowledge of things.
More must be heard. It would be impossible not to risk
everything to hear more.
</p>

<p>
Alma ordered fresh tea; Mr. Wilson and the husband
and the two new men were standing about. The elder
man was describing in a large shouting voice a new mantelpiece&mdash;a
Tudor mantelpiece. What was a Tudor mantelpiece?
... to buy a <em>house</em> to put round it. What a clever
idea.... Little Mr. Wilson seemed to be listening; he
squealed amendments of the jests between the big man&rsquo;s
boomings ... buy a <em>town</em> to put round it.... What a
lovely idea ... buy a <span class="sc">nation</span> to put round it ... there
was a burst of guffaws. Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s face was crimson;
his eyes appeared to be full of tears. The big man went
on. Mrs. Binkley kept uttering deep reedy caressing laughs.
Two of the young men were leaning forward talking eagerly
with bent heads. Miriam&rsquo;s neighbour sat upright with
his hands on his knees, his eyes glaring as if ... as if he
were just going to jump out of his skin. Hidden by the
increased stir made by the re-entry of the maid, and
encouraged by the extraordinary clamour of hilarious voices
Miriam ventured to ask him if he would perform an act of
<a id="page-120" class="pagenum" title="120"></a>
charity by allowing her to rob him of one of his cigarettes.
She liked her unrecognisable voice. It was pitched deep,
but strong; a little like Mrs. Binkley&rsquo;s. The young man
started and turned eagerly towards her, stammering and
muttering and fumbling about his person. &ldquo;I swear&rdquo; he
brought out, &ldquo;I could cut my throat ... my <em>God</em> ...
oh here we are.&rdquo; Seizing the open box from the tea-table
he swung round with his crossed legs extended across her
corner so that she was cut off from the rest of the room,
and held the box eagerly towards her. They both took
cigarettes and he lit them with matches obtained from his
neighbour. &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; said Miriam blissfully drawing
&ldquo;that has saved my life.&rdquo; Precipitately restoring the
matches he swung round again leaning forward with his
elbow on his knee, blocking out Miriam&rsquo;s view. Before it
was blocked out she had caught the eye of Mr. Wilson
who was standing facing her in the little group of men about
the tea-table and still interpolating their hubbub with
husky squeals of jocularity, quietly observing the drama
in her corner. For the moment she did not wish to listen;
Alma&rsquo;s appreciative squeals were getting strained and the
big man was a bore. Seen sitting in profile taking his tea
he reminded her of Mr. Staple-Craven; her eye caught
and recoiled from weak patches, touches of frowsy softness
here and there about the shaggy head. Cut off from the
room safe in the extraordinary preoccupation of the young
man whose eager brooding was moving now towards some
imminent communication&mdash;she had undisturbed knowledge
of what she had done. Speech and action had launched
her, for good or ill, into the strange tide running in this
house. Its cold waters beat against her breast. She was no
longer quite herself. There was something in it that
quickened all her faculties, challenged all the strength she
possessed. By speech and action she had accepted something
she neither liked, nor approved nor understood;
refusal would have left its secret unplumbed, standing
aside in her life, tormenting it. The sense of the secret
<a id="page-121" class="pagenum" title="121"></a>
intoxicated her ... perhaps I am selling my soul to the
devil. But she was glad that Mr. Wilson had witnessed her
launching.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are magnificent&rdquo; gasped the young man glaring
at the wall. &ldquo;I mean you are simply magnificent.&rdquo; He
flashed unconscious eyes at her&mdash;<em>he</em> had no consciousness of
the cold tide with its curious touch of evil; it was hand
in hand with him and his simplicity that she had stepped
down into the water&mdash;and hurried on. &ldquo;An angel of
dreams. Dreams ... you know&mdash;I say,&rdquo; he spluttered
incoherently, &ldquo;I <em>must</em> tell you.&rdquo; His working preoccupied
face turned to face hers with a jerk that brought part of the
heavy sheaf of hair across one of his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing
the best work this week I ever did in my life!&rdquo; Red flooded
the whole of his face and the far-away glare of his one
visible eye became a blaze of light, near, and smiling a
guilty delighted smile. He was demanding <em>her</em> approval,
<em>her</em> sympathy, just on the strength of her being there.
It was the moment of consenting to Alma that had brought
this. However it had come she would have been unable
to withstand it. He wanted approval and sympathy;
someone here had some time or other shut him up; perhaps
he was considered second-rate, perhaps he was second-rate;
but he was innocent as no one else in the room was innocent.
&ldquo;<em>Oh</em>, I <em>am</em> glad&rdquo; she replied swiftly. Putting his cigarette
on the edge of the piano he seized one of her hands and
crushed it between his own. His face perspired and there
were tears in his eye. &ldquo;<em>Do</em> tell me about it&rdquo; she said with
bold uneasy eagerness hoping he would drop her hand
when he spoke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a play&rdquo; he shouted in a low whisper,
a spray of saliva springing through his lips &ldquo;a play&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
finest stuff I ever rout.&rdquo; Were all these people either
cockney or with that very bland anglican cultured way of
speaking&mdash;like the husband and the man with the Tudor
mantelpiece?

&ldquo;I can of course admit that the growth of corn was, at
first, accidental and unconscious, and that even after the
succession of processes began to be grasped and the soil
methodically cultivated the success of the crop was supposed
to depend upon the propitiation of a <em>god</em>. I can see
that the discovery of the possibility of growing <em>food</em> would
enormously alter the savage&rsquo;s conception of God, by introducing
a new set of attributes into his <em>consciousness</em> of him;
but in defining the God of the Christians as a <em>corn</em> deity
you and Allen are putting the cart before the horse.&rdquo;

That was it, that was it&mdash;that was right somehow; there
was something in this big red-faced man that was not in
Mr. Wilson; but why did his talk sound so lame and dull,
even while he was saving God&mdash;and Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s, while
he made God from the beginning a nothing created by the
fears and needs of man, so thrilling and convincing, so
painting the world anew? He was wrong about everything
and yet while he talked everything changed in spite of yourself.

The earlier part of the afternoon looked a bright happy
world behind the desolation of this conflict; the husband
and wife and the young men and Mrs. Binkley and the
bright afternoon light, dear far-off friends ... withstanding
in their absence the chilly light of Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s
talk. Who was Mr. Wilson? But he was so certain that
men had created God ... life in that thought was a nightmare.
Nothing that could happen could make it anything
but a nightmare henceforth ... it did not matter what
happened, and yet he seemed pleased, amused about everything
and eager to go on and &ldquo;do&rdquo; things and get things
done.... His belief about life was worse than agnosticism.
There was no doubt in it. &ldquo;Mr. G&rdquo; was an invention of
man. There was nothing but man; man, coming from the
ape, some men a little cleverer than others, men had discovered
science, science was the only enlightenment, science
<a id="page-123" class="pagenum" title="123"></a>
would put everything right; scientific imagination,
scientific invention. Man. Women were there, cleverly
devised by nature to ensnare man for a moment and produce
more men; to bring scientific order out of primeval
chaos; chaos was decreasing order increasing; there was
nothing worth considering before the coming of science;
the business of the writer was imagination, not romantic
imagination, but realism, fine realism, the truth about
&ldquo;the savage&rdquo; about all the past and present, the avoidance
of cliché ... what was cliché?...

Miriam went from the sitting room she had entered in
another age with the bedroom violets pinned against her
collarette, stripped and cold and hungry into the cold of
the brightly-lit little dining room. The gay cold dishes,
the bright jellies and fruits, the brown nuts, the pretty
Italian wine in thin white long-necked decanters ...
Chianti ... Chianti ... they all seemed familiar with
the wine and the word; perhaps it was a familiar wine
at the Wilson supper-parties; they spoke of it sitting at
the little feast amongst the sternness of nothing but small
drawings and engravings on walls that shone some clear
light tone against the few pieces of unfamiliar grey-brown
furniture like people clustering round a fire. But it was a
feast of death; terrible because of their not knowing that
it was a feast of death. The wife of the cockatoo had come
in early enough to hear nearly the whole of the conversation
and had sat listening to it with a quiet fresh talkative
face under her fresh dark hair; the large deep furrow
between her eyebrows was nothing to do with anything
here, it was permanent, belonging to her life. She had
brought her life in with her and kept it there, the freshness
and the furrow; she seemed now, at supper to be out
for the evening, to enjoy herself&mdash;at the Wilsons&rsquo; ...
<a id="page-124" class="pagenum" title="124"></a>
coming to the Wilsons&rsquo; ... for a jolly evening, just as
anybody would go anywhere for a jolly evening. She did
not know what was there, what it all meant. Perhaps
because of the two little boys. She, with two little unseen
boys and the big house so near, big and full of her and
noise and things, and her freshness and the furrow of her
thought about it prevented anything from going on; the
dreadful thing had to be dropped where it was, leaving the
big man who had fought to pretend to be interested and
amused, leaving Mr. Wilson with the last word and his
quiet smothered giggle.

Alma tried to answer Mrs. Pinner&rsquo;s loud fresh talking
in the way things had been answered earlier in the afternoon
before the departure of all the other people. Everything
she said was an attempt to beat things up. Every
time she spoke Miriam was conscious of something in the
room that would be there with them all if only Alma would
leave off being funny; something there was in life that
Alma had never yet known, something that belonged to an
atmosphere she would call &ldquo;dull.&rdquo; Mr. Wilson knew that
something ... had it in him somewhere, but feared it and
kept it out by trying to be bigger, by trying to be the biggest
thing there was. Alma went on and on, sometimes uncomfortably
failing, her thin voice sounding out like a corkscrew
in a cork without any bottle behind it, now and
again provoking a response which made things worse
because it brought to the table the shamed sense of trying
to keep something going.... The clever excitements would
not come back. Mrs. Binkley would have helped her....
Miriam sat helpless and miserable between her admiration
of Alma&rsquo;s efforts and her longing for the thing Alma kept
out. Her discomfiture at Alma&rsquo;s resentment of her dulness
and Alma&rsquo;s longing for Mrs. Binkley was made endurable
by her anger over Alma&rsquo;s obstructiveness. Mr. Pinner and
the big man were busily feeding. Mrs. Pinner laughed
and now and again tried to imitate Alma; as if she had
learned how it was done by many visits to the Wilsons&rsquo;,
<a id="page-125" class="pagenum" title="125"></a>
and then forgot and talked in her own way, forgetting to
try to say good things. Alma grew smaller as supper went
on and Mr. and Mrs. Pinner larger and larger. Together
they were too strong in their sense of some other life and
some other way of looking at things to give the Wilson
way a clear field. Mr. Wilson began monologues in favourable
intervals, but they tailed off for lack of nourishing
response. Miriam listened eagerly and suspiciously; lost
in admiration and a silent, mentally wordless opposition.
She felt the big man was on her side and that the Pinners
would be if they could understand. They only saw the
jokes ... the&mdash;the, higher facetiousness ... good phrase,
that was the Chianti. And they were getting used to that;
perhaps they were secretly a little tired of it.

<p class="noindent">
After supper Mr. Pinner sang very neatly in a small clear
tenor voice an English translation of <a id="thule"></a>Es war ein König im
Thule. Miriam longed for the German words; Mr. Pinner
cancelled even the small remainder of the German sentiment
by his pronunciation of the English rendering; &ldquo;there
was a king of old tame&rdquo; he declared and so on throughout
the song. Alma followed with a morsel of Chopin. The
performance drove Miriam into a rage. Mr. Pinner had
murdered his German ballad innocently, his little Oxford
voice and his false vowels did not conceal the pleasure he
took in singing his unimagined little song, Alma played her
piece at her audience, every line of her face and body proclaiming
it fine music, the right sort of music, and deprecating
all the compositions that were not &ldquo;music.&rdquo; It was
clear that her taste had become cultivated, that she <em>knew</em>
now, that the scales had fallen from her eyes as they had
fallen from Miriam&rsquo;s eyes in Germany; but the result
sent Miriam back with a rush to cheap music, sentimental
&ldquo;obvious&rdquo; music, shapely waltzes, the demoralising
chromatics of Gounod, the demoralising descriptive passion
<a id="page-126" class="pagenum" title="126"></a>
pieces of <a id="corr-25"></a>Chaminade, those things by Liszt whom somebody
had called a charlatan who wrote to make your blood
leap and your feet dance and made your blood leap and
your feet dance ... why not?...
</p>

<p>
Her mind went on amazed at the rushing together of
her ideas on music, at the amount of certainty she had
accumulated. Any of these things she declared to herself
played, really <em>played</em>, would be better than Alma&rsquo;s Chopin.
The Wilsons had discovered &ldquo;good&rdquo; music, as so many
English people had, but they were all wrong about music;
nearly all English people were. Only in England would
either the song or the solo have been possible. The song
was innocent, the solo was an insult. The player&rsquo;s air of
superiority to other music was insufferable; her way of
playing out bar by bar of the rain on the roof as if she were
giving a lesson was a piece of intellectual snobbery. Chopin
she had never met, never felt or glimpsed. Chopin was a
shape, an endless delicate stern rhythm as stern as anything
in music; all he was came through that, could come only
through it and she played tricks with the shape, falsified
all the values, outdid the worst trickery of the music she
was deprecating. At the end of the performance which
was applauded with a subdued reverence, Miriam eased
her agony by humming the opening phase of the motive
again and again in her brain and very nearly aloud, it was
such a perfect rhythmic drop. For long she was haunted
and tortured by Alma&rsquo;s horrible holding back of the third
note for emphasis where there was no emphasis ... it was
like ... finding a <em>wart</em> at the dropping end of a fine tendril,
she was telling herself furiously while she fended off Alma&rsquo;s
cajoling efforts to make her join in a game of cards. She
felt too angry and too suffering&mdash;what <em>was</em> this wrong
thing about music in all English people&mdash;even if she had
not been too shy to exhibit her large hands and her stupidity
at cards. So they were going to play cards, actually cards.
The room felt cold to her in her long suppressed anger and
misery. She began to wish the Pinners would go. Sitting
<a id="page-127" class="pagenum" title="127"></a>
by the fire shivering and torpid she listened to Mrs. Pinner&rsquo;s
outcries and the elaboration between the rounds of jests
that she felt were weekly jests. Sitting there dully listening
she began to have a sort of insight into the way these jests
were made, it was a thing that could be cultivated. Her
tired brain experimented. Certain things she heard she
knew she would remember; she felt she would repeat
them&mdash;with an air of originality. They would seem very
brilliant in any of her circles&mdash;though the girls did that
sort of thing rather well; but in a less &ldquo;refined&rdquo; way;
that was true! This was the sort of thing the girls did;
only their way was not half so clever ... if she did, everyone
would wonder what was the matter with her; and she
would not be able to keep it up, without a great deal of
practice; and it would keep out something else ... but
perhaps for some people there was something in it; it was
their way. It had always been Alma&rsquo;s way a little. Only
now she did it better. Perhaps ... it was like Chopin&rsquo;s
shape.... They do not know how angry I have been ...
they are quite amiable. I am simply horrid ... wanting
Alma to know I know she&rsquo;s wrong quite as much as I care
for Chopin; perhaps more ... no; if <em>anybody</em> had <em>played</em>,
I should be happy; perfectly happy ... what does that
mean ... because real musicians are not at all nice people
... &ldquo;a queer soft lot.&rdquo; But why are the English so awful
about music? They are poets. Why are they not musicians?
I hope I shall never hear Alma play Beethoven. As long as
she plays Chopin like that I shall never like her.... Perhaps
English people ought never to play, only to listen to music.
They are not innocent enough to play. They cannot
forget themselves.
</p>

<p>
At ten o&rsquo;clock they trooped into the kitchen. Miriam,
half asleep and starving for food, eagerly ate large biscuits
too hungry to care much for Alma&rsquo;s continued resentment
of her failure to join the card party and her unconcealed
contempt of her sudden return to animation at the prospect
of nourishment. She had never felt so hungry.

Going at last to her room Miriam found its gleaming
freshness warm and firelit. Warm fresh deeps of softly
coloured room that were complete before she came in with
her candle. She stood a moment imagining the emptiness.
The April night air was streaming gently in from meadows.
Going across to the window she hesitated near the flowered
curtain. It stirred gently; but not in that way as if moved
by ghostly fingers. The meadows here were different.
They might grow the same again. But woods and meadows
were always there, away from London. One could go to
them. They were going on all the time. All the time in
London spring and summer and autumn were passing unseen.
But this was not the time. They were <em>different</em> here. She
pulled a deep wicker chair close up to the exciting white
ash-sprinkled hearth. The evening she had left in the
flames downstairs was going on up here. To-morrow,
to-day, in a few hours she would be sitting with them
again, facing flames; no one else there. She sat with
her eyes on the flames. A clock struck two.... I&rsquo;ve got
to them at last, the people I ought to be with. The books
in the corner showed their bindings and opened their pages
here and there. They made a little sick patch on her heart.
They approved of them. Other people approved of things.
Nothing had been done yet that anybody could approve
of ... the <em>some</em>thing village of Grandpré ... und dann
sagte darauf, die gute vernünftige Hausfrau.... It all
floated in the air. They would see it if somebody showed
it. They would be angry and amused if anybody tried
to show it. It was wrong in some way to try and show the
things you were looking at. Keep quiet about them.
Then somebody else expressed them; and those other
people turned to you and demanded your admiration&mdash;and
wondered why you were furious. It&rsquo;s too long to wait,
until the things come up of themselves. You <em>must</em> attend
to them....

How the fragrance of the cigarette stood out upon the
fresh warm air ... that was perique, that curious strong
flavour. They were very strong, he had said so; but
downstairs, talking like that they had had no particular
flavour, just cigarettes, bringing the cigarette mood ...
no wonder he had been surprised, really surprised, at her
smoking so many ... but then he had been surprised at
her eating a hard apple at midnight ... the sitting room
had suddenly looked familiar going into it alone while
they were seeing out the Pinners and the big man. Strange
unknown voices that perhaps she would not hear again,
going out into the night ... their voices jesting the last
jests as the guests went down the garden, sounding in the
hall, familiar and homely, well known to her, presently
coming back into the sitting room; the fire burning brightly
like any other fire, the exciting deep pinkness of the shaded
lamplight like nothing else in the world. Alma knew it,
rushing in ... whirling about with Alma in that room
with that afternoon left in it; the sounds of bolting and
locking coming in from the hall.

Nearing London shivering and exhausted she recalled
Sunday morning and the strangeness of it being just as it
had promised to be. Happy waking with a clear refreshed
brain in a tired drowsy body, like the feeling after a dance;
making the next morning part of the dance, your mind
full of pictures and thoughts and the evening coming up
again and again, one great clear picture in the foreground
of your mind. The <em>evening</em> in the room as you sat propped
on your pillows drinking the clear pale curiously refreshing
tea left by the maid on a little wooden tray by your bedside;
its fragrance drew you to sip at once, without adding
milk and sugar. It was delicious; it steamed aromatically
up your nostrils and went straight to your brain; potent
<a id="page-131" class="pagenum" title="131"></a>
without being bitter. Perhaps it was &ldquo;China&rdquo; tea; it
must be. The two biscuits on the little plate disappeared
rapidly, and she poured in milk and added much sugar
to her remaining tea to appease her hunger. The evening
stayed during her deliberately perfunctory toilet; she
wanted only to be down. It began again unbroken with
the first cigarette after breakfast, when a nimble remark
thrown out from the excited gravity of her happiness made
Mr. Wilson laugh. She was learning how to do it. It
stayed on through the day, adding the day to itself in a
chain, a morning of talk, a visit to Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s study&mdash;the
curious glimpses of pinewood from the windows; pinewood
looking strange and far-away&mdash;there were people
in Weybridge to whom those woods were real woods where
they walked and perhaps had the thoughts that woods
bring; here they were like woods in a picture book; not
real, just a curious painted background for Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s
talk ... all those books in fifty years&rsquo; time burnt up by the
air; he did not seem to think it an awful idea ... you can
do anything with English ... and then the names of
authors who had done some of these things with English
... making it sing and dance and march, making it like
granite or like film and foam. Other languages were more
simple and single in texture; less flexible.... Gazing
out at the exciting silent pines&mdash;so dark and still, waiting,
not knowing about the wonders of English&mdash;Miriam
recalled her impressions of those of the authors she knew.
It was true that those were their effects and the great
differences between them. How did he come to know all
about it and to put it into words? Did the authors know
when they did it? She passionately hoped not. If they
did, it was a trick and spoilt books. Rows and rows of
&ldquo;fine&rdquo; books; nothing but men sitting in studies doing
something cleverly, being very important, &ldquo;men of letters&rdquo;;
and looking out for approbation. If writing meant that,
it was not worth doing. English a great flexible language;
more than any other in the world. But German was the
<a id="page-132" class="pagenum" title="132"></a>
same? Only the inflections filled the sentences up with
bits. English was flexible and beautiful. Funny.
Foreigners did not think so. Many English people thought
foreign literature the best. Perhaps Mr. Wilson did not
know much foreign literature. But he wanted to; or he
would not have those translations of Ibsen and Björnsen.
German poetry marched and sang and did all sorts of things.
Anyhow it was wonderful about English&mdash;but if books
were written like that, sitting down and doing it cleverly
and knowing just what you were doing and just how somebody
else had done it, there was something wrong, some
mannish cleverness that was only half right. To write
books, knowing all about style would be to become like a
man. Women who wrote books and learned these things
would be absurd and would make men absurd. There was
something wrong. It was in all those books upstairs. &ldquo;Good
stuff&rdquo; was wrong, a clever trick, not worth doing. And
yet everybody seemed to want to write.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the day&mdash;secret and wonderful. Sitting about,
taken for one of the Wilson kind of people, someone who
was writing or going to write, by the two Scotch professors;
sitting about listening to their quiet easy eager unconcerned
talk, seeing them &ldquo;all round&rdquo; as Mr. Wilson saw them,
the limits of professorship and teaching, the silly net and
trick of examinations, their simplicity and their helplessness;
playing the lovely accompaniment like quiet waves,
of Schubert&rsquo;s Ave Maria, the sudden, jolly, sentimental
voice of Professor Ewings, his nice attentions ... if it
had been Wimpole Street or anywhere in society he would
not have seen me....
</p>

<p>
It would be wrong to try and write just because Mr.
Wilson had said one ought.... The reasons he had given
for writing were the wrong ones ... but it would be
impossible to go down again without doing some writing....
Impossible not to go down again.... They knew
one was &ldquo;different&rdquo;; and liked it and thought it a good
thing; a sort of distinction. No one had thought that
<a id="page-133" class="pagenum" title="133"></a>
before. It made them a home and a refuge. The only
refuge there was except being by oneself ... only their
kind of difference was not the same. They thought nearly
everyone &ldquo;futile&rdquo; and &ldquo;dull&rdquo;&mdash;everyone who did not see
things in their way was that. Presently they would find
that one was not different in the same way. He had spoken
of people who grow &ldquo;dull&rdquo; as you get to know them.
Awful ... perhaps already, he meant&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="tb">

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well ... people read Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s
simple profundities; er&mdash;simple profundities; and learn

with this swell ... hcna ... <em>puffing</em> with illumination.
All about <em>nothing</em>. It&rsquo;s all, my dear Miss Henderson,
about absolutely nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;

<p class="noindent">
The train stopped. Better not to go down again. There
was something all wrong in it. Wrong about everything.
The Pinners and the big man were right ... but there
was something dreadful in them, the something that is in
all simple right sort of people, who just go on, never thinking
about anything. Were they good and right? It did
not enter their heads to think that they were wrong in
associating with him.... Here in London it seemed wrong
... she hurried wearily with aching head up the long
platform. The Wimpole Street people would certainly
think it wrong; if they knew about the marriage. They
knew he was a coming great man; the great new &ldquo;critic&rdquo;;
a new kind of critic ... they knew everybody was beginning
to talk about him. But if they knew they would not
approve. They would never understand his way of seeing
things. Impossible to convey anything to them of what
the visit had been.

The hall clock said half-past nine. The hall and the
large rooms had shrunk. Everything looked shabby and
homely. The house was perfectly quiet. Passing quietly
and quickly into her room she found the table empty.
The door into the den was shut and no sound came from
behind it. No one but James had seen her. The holiday
was still there. Perhaps there would be time to take hold
in the new way before anyone discovered her and made
demands. Perhaps they were all three wanting her at this
moment. But the house was so still, there was nothing
urgent. Perhaps she would never feel nervous at Wimpole
Street again. It was really all so easy. There was nothing
she could not manage if only she could get a fair start and
get everything in order and up to date. Her mind tried
to encircle the book-keeping. There must be a plan for it
all; so much work on the accounts to keep the whole
ledger-full sent out to date, so much on the address books,
and so much on the monthly cash books&mdash;a little of all
these things every day in addition to the day&rsquo;s work, whatever
happened; that would do it. Then there would
be no muddle and nothing to worry about and perhaps time
to write. They must be told that she would use any spare
time there was on other things.... They would be quite
ready for that provided the books were always up to date
and the surgeries always in order. That is what a Wilson
would have done from the first.

moment of sympathetic waiting, back down the basement
stairs to her dinner. Miriam felt herself very tall and
<a id="page-135" class="pagenum" title="135"></a>
slender&mdash;set apart and surrounded; healed of all fighting
and effort. She went quickly through the hall thinking
of nothing; herself, walking down Harriett&rsquo;s garden path.
At the door of the waiting-room she hesitated. Mr. Grove
was the other side of the door, waiting for her to come in.
She opened the door with a flourish and advanced with
stiffly outstretched hand. Before she said &ldquo;teeth?&rdquo; in a
cheerful breezy professional tone that exploded into the
past and scattered it she saw the pained anxiousness of his
face and the flush that had risen under his dark skin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&rdquo; he said recoiling swiftly from his limp handshake
and sitting abruptly down on the chair from which he had
risen. Miriam watched him go helplessly on to say in stiff
resentfulness what he had come to say while she stood
apologetically at his chair side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I meant to write to you&mdash;two or three times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she responded emphatically....
Why can&rsquo;t I be quiet and hear what he has to say? He
must have wanted to see me dreadfully to come here like this.
</p>

<p>
His eyes were fixed blindly upon the far-off window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I wanted to very much. How do you like your
life here?&rdquo; He was flushing again. His skin still had that
shiny film over it, so unlike the clear snaky brilliance of the
eyes. They were dreadful and all the rest flappy and
floppy and somehow feverish.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I like it immensely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a very good thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like your life?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He drew in his lower lip on an indrawn breath and held
it with his teeth. His eyes were thinking busily under a
slight frown.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is one of the things I wished to discuss with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh <em>do</em> discuss it with me,&rdquo; cried Miriam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very glad you are getting on here so well&rdquo; he
murmured thoughtfully, gazing through the window, to
and fro as if scanning the opposite house-fronts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I like it immensely&rdquo; said Miriam after a silence.
<a id="page-136" class="pagenum" title="136"></a>
Her head was beginning to ache. He sat quite still, scanning
to and fro, his lip recaptured under his teeth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are such nice people. I like it for so many things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked absently round at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;M-yes. On several occasions I thought of writing to
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Miriam sitting down opposite to him.
</p>

<p>
He shifted a little in his chair to keep his way clear to
the window.
</p>

<p>
For a few moments they sat silent; then he suddenly
took out his watch and stood up.
</p>

<p>
Miriam rose. &ldquo;Have you seen the Ducaynes lately?&rdquo;
she asked hurriedly, moving nervously towards the door.
Murmuring an indistinct response he led the way to the
door and held it open for her.
</p>

<p>
James was coming forward with a patient. They stood
aside for the patient to pass in, James waiting to escort Mr.
Grove to the front door. They shook hands limply and
silently. Miriam stood watching his narrow loosely knit
clerical back as he plunged along through the hall and out.
She turned as James turned from the door.... What
it must have cost him to break in here and ask for me
... how silly and how rude I was.... I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> believe he&rsquo;s
been; it&rsquo;s like a dream. He&rsquo;s seen me in the new life
changed ... and I&rsquo;m not really changed.

<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> morning went on. It seemed as though there was
to be no opportunity of telling Mr. Hancock until
lunch had changed the feeling of the day. He knew there was
something. Turning to select an instrument from a drawer
she was at work upon he had caught sight of her mirth
and smiled his amusement and anticipation into the drawer
before turning gravely back to the chair. Perhaps that
was enough, the best, like a moment of amusement you
share with a stranger and never forget. Perhaps by the
time she was able to tell him he would be disappointed.
No. It was too perfect. Just the sort of thing that amused
him.
</p>

<p>
He had one long sitting after another, the time given
to one patient overlapping the appointment with the next
so that her clearings and cleansings were done with a patient
in the chair, noiselessly and slowly, keeping her in the room,
making to-day seem like a continuation of yesterday afternoon.
Yesterday shed its radiance. The shared mirth made
a glowing background to her toil. The duties accumulating
downstairs made her continued presence in the surgery a
sort of truancy. She felt more strongly than ever the sense
of her usefulness to him. She had never so far helped him
so deftly and easily, being everywhere and nowhere, foreseeing
his needs without impeding his movements, doing
everything without reminding the patient that there was
a third person in the room. She followed sympathetically
the long slow processes of excavation and root treatment,
the delicate shaping and undercutting of the walls of
cavities, the adjustment and retention of the many appliances
<a id="page-139" class="pagenum" title="139"></a>
for the exclusion of moisture, the insertions of the amalgams
and pastes whose pounding and mixing made a recurrent
crisis in her morning. She wished again and again that
the dentally ignorant dentally ironic world could see the
operator at his best; in his moments of quiet intense concentration
on giving his best to his patients.

<p class="noindent">
The patients suffering the four long sittings were all of
the best group, leisurely and untroubled as to the mounting
up of guineas and three of them intelligently appreciative
of what was being done. <em>They</em> knew all about the &ldquo;status&rdquo;
of modern dentistry and the importance of teeth. They
were all clear serene tranquil cheerful people who probably
hardly ever went to a doctor. They would rate oculists
and dentists on a level with doctors and two of them at
least would rate Mr. Hancock on a level with anybody....
Tomorrow would be quite different, a rush of gas cases,
that man who was sick if an instrument touched the back
of his tongue; Mrs. Wolff, disputing fees, the deaf-mute,
the grubby little man on a newspaper ... he ought to have
no patients but these intelligent ones and really nervous
and delicate people and children.

&ldquo;I sometimes wish I&rsquo;d stuck to medicine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. You know they get a good deal
more all round out of their profession than a dentist does.
It absorbs them more.... I don&rsquo;t say it ought not to
be the same with dentistry. But it isn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know a
dentist who wants to go on talking shop until the small
hours. I&rsquo;m quite sure <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t. Now look at Randle.
He was dining here last night. So was Bentley. We
separated at about midnight; and Randle told me this
morning that he and Bentley walked up and down Harley
Street telling each other stories, until two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-140" class="pagenum" title="140"></a>
&ldquo;That simply means they talk about their patients.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes. They discuss their cases from every point
of view. They get more human interest out of their work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course everybody knows that medical students and
doctors are famous for stories. But it doesn&rsquo;t really mean
they know anything about <em>people</em>. I don&rsquo;t believe they do.
I think the dentist has quite as much opportunity of studying
human nature. Going through dentistry is like dying.
You must know almost everything about a patient who has
had much done, or even a little&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The fact of the matter is their profession is a hobby to
them as well as a profession. That&rsquo;s the truth of the matter.
Now I think a man who can make a hobby of his profession
is a very fortunate man.&rdquo;

How surprised the four friendly wealthy patients, especially
the white-haired old aristocrat who was always pressing
invitations upon him would have been, ignoring or treating
her with the kindly consideration due to people of her
station, if they could have seen inside his house yesterday
and beheld her ensconced in the most comfortable chair
in his drawing-room ... talking to Miss Szigmondy.

<p class="noindent">
Each time she came downstairs she sat urgently down
to the most pressing of her clerical duties and presently
found her mind ranging amongst thoughts whose beginnings
she could not remember. She felt equal to anything.
Every prospect was open to her. Simple solutions to
problems that commonly went unanswered round and round
in her head presented themselves in flashes. At intervals
she worked with a swiftness and ease that astonished her,
making no mistakes, devising small changes and adjustments
that would make for the smoother working of the practice,
dashing off notes to friends in easy expressive phrases that
came without thought.

Rushing up towards lunch time in answer to the bell
she found Mr. Hancock alone. He turned from the washstand
and stood carefully drying his hands. &ldquo;Are they
showing up?&rdquo; he murmured and seeing her, smiled his
sense of her eagerness to communicate and approached a
few steps waiting and smiling with the whole of his face
exactly as he would smile when the communication was
made. There was really no need to tell. Miriam glanced
back for an incoming patient. &ldquo;Miss Szig<em>mon</em>dy&rdquo; she
began in a voice deep with laughter.
</p>

<p>
He laughed at once, with a little backward throw of his
head just as the patient came in. Miriam glided swiftly
into her corner.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-8-7">

<p class="noindent">
At tea-time she found herself happily exhausted, sitting
alone in the den waiting for the sound of footsteps. For
the first time the gas-stove was unlit. The rows of asbestos
balls stood white and bare. But a flood of sunlight came
through the western panes of the newly washed skylight.
The little low tea-table with its fresh uncrumpled low
hanging white cover and compact cluster of delicate china
stood in full sunshine amidst the comfortable winter shabbiness.
The decorative confusion on the walls shone richly
out in the new bright light. It needed only to have all the
skylights open the blue of the sky visible, the thin spring
air coming in, the fire alight making a summery glow, to
be perfect; like spring tea-time in a newly visited house.
The Wilsons&rsquo; sitting-room would be in an open blaze of
shallow spring sunshine. She saw it going on day by day
towards the rich light of summer ... jealously. One
ought to be there every day. So much life would have
passed through the room. Every day last week had been
full of it, everything changed by it, and now, since yesterday
<a id="page-142" class="pagenum" title="142"></a>
it seemed months ago. It seemed too late to begin going
down again. One thing blots out another. You cannot
have more than one thing intensely. Quite soon it would
be as if she had never been down; except in moments
now and again, when something recalled the challenge of
their point of view. They would not want her to go down
again unless she had begun to be different. Until yesterday
she might have begun. But yesterday afternoon they had
been forgotten so completely, and waking up from yesterday
she no longer wanted to begin their way of being
different. But other people had already begun to identify
her with them. That came of talking. If she had said
nothing, nothing would have been changed; either at
Wimpole Street or with the girls. Did they really like
reading &ldquo;The Evolution of the Idea of God&rdquo; or were
they only pretending? Sewing all the time, busily, like
wives, instead of smoking and listening and thinking.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Which was the stronger? The interest of getting the
whole picture there, and struggling with Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s
deductions or the interest of getting the girls to grasp and
admire his conclusions even while she herself refused
them....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I keep quiet about the things that happen?
It&rsquo;s all me, my conceit and my way of rushing into things.&rdquo;
... But other people were the same in a way. Only there
was something real in their way. They believed in the
things they rushed into. &ldquo;Miss Henderson knows the
great critic, intimately.&rdquo; He had thought that would
impress Miss Szigmondy. It did. For a moment she had
stopped talking and looked surprised. There was time to
disclaim, to tell them they were being impressed in the
wrong way; to tell them something, to explain in some way.
The moment had passed, full of terrible far-off trouble,
&ldquo;decisive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
There is always a fraction of a second when you know
<a id="page-143" class="pagenum" title="143"></a>
what you are doing. Miss Szigmondy would have gone
on talking about bicycling until Mr. Hancock came back.
There was no need to say suddenly, without thinking about
it &ldquo;I am dying to learn.&rdquo; <em>Really</em> that sudden remark was
the result of having failed to speak when they were all
talking about Mr. Wilson. If, then, one had suddenly
said &ldquo;I am dying to learn bicycling&rdquo; or <em>anything</em> they
would have known something of the truth about Mr.
Wilson. It was the worrying thought of him, still there,
that made one say, without thinking, &ldquo;I am dying to
learn.&rdquo; It was too late. It linked up with the silence about
Mr. Wilson and left one being a person who knew and
altogether approved of Mr. Wilson and wanted to learn
bicycling. Altogether wrong. &ldquo;You know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t approve
of Mr. Wilson; and you might not if you heard him talk,
and ... his marriage ... you know....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
... If I had done that, I should have been easy and
strong and could have &lsquo;made conversation&rsquo; when she began
talking about bicycling. I was like the man who proposed
to the girl at the dance because he could not think of anything
to say to her. He could not think of anything to say
because he had something on his mind....
</p>

<p>
And Miss Szigmondy would not have called this morning.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;<em>No</em> one can <a id="pgonounce"></a>pgonounce my name. You had better call
me <a id="thegese"></a>Thégèse my dear girl. Yes, do; I want you to.&rdquo; She
had said that with a worried face, a sudden manner of
unsmiling intimacy. She certainly had some plan. Standing
there with her broken hearted voice and her anxious face
she seemed to be separate from the room, even from her
own clothes. Yet something within her was moving so
quickly that it made one breathless. She was so intent
that she was unconscious of the appealing little figure she
made huddled in her English clothes. She stood dressed
and determined and prosperous her smart little toque held
closely against her dark hair and sallow face with the kind
of chenille-spotted veil that was a rampart against <em>everything</em>
<a id="page-144" class="pagenum" title="144"></a>
in the world to an Englishwoman. But it did not
touch her or do anything for her. It gave an effect of
prison bars behind which she was hanging her head and
weeping and appealing. One could have laughed and
gathered her up. Why was she forlorn? Why did she
imagine that one was also forlorn? The sight of her made
all the forlornness one had ever seen or read about seem
peopled with knowledge and sympathy and warm thoughts
that flew crowding along one&rsquo;s brain as close and bright
as the texture of everybody&rsquo;s everyday. But the eyes were
anxious and preoccupied, blinking now and then in her
long unswerving appealing gaze, shutting swiftly for
lightning calculations between her rapid appealing statements.
What was she trying to do?
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
She tried to stand in front of everything, to put everything
aside as if it were part of something she knew.
Laughing over it with Mr. Hancock would not dispose of
that. After the fun of telling him, she would still be there,
with the two bicycle lessons that were going begging. He
knew already that she had been and would assume that
she had suggested things and that one was not going to do
them. If one told him about the lessons he would say that
is very kind and would mean it. He was always fine in
thinking a &ldquo;kind&rdquo; action kind ... but she does not come
because she wants me. She does not want anybody. She
does not know the difference between one person and
another.... He knows only her social manner. She has
never been alone with him and come close and shown him
her determination and her sorrow ... sorrow ...
sorrow....
</p>

<p>
He could never see that it was impossible without forcibly
crushing her, to get out of doing some part of what she
desired....
</p>

<p>
If one were drawn in and did things, let oneself want
to do things for anyone else, there would be a change in the
atmosphere at Wimpole Street. That never occurred to
<a id="page-145" class="pagenum" title="145"></a>
him. But he would feel it if it happened. If there were
someone near who made distractions there would be a
difference, something that was not given to him. He was
so unaware of this. He was absolutely ignorant of what
it was that kept things going as they were.

<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> cycling school was out of sight and done with and
Miriam hurried down the Chalk Farm Road. If
only she could see an omnibus and be in it going anywhere
down away from the north. Miss Szigmondy had brought
shame and misery upon her, in Chalk Farm. There was
nothing there to keep off the pain. Once back she would
never think of Chalk Farm again. How could anyone think
it was a place, like other places? It was torture even to be
in it, going through it.... Of course the man had thought
I should take on a course of lessons and pay for them. I
have to learn everything meanly and shamefully. He thinks
I&rsquo;m getting all I can for nothing. The people in the bus
will see me pay my fare and I shall be all right again, going
down there. What an <em>awful</em> road, going on and on with
nothing in it. I am shamed and helpless; <em>helpless</em>. It&rsquo;s no
use to try and do anything. It always exposes me and brings
this maddening shame and pain. It&rsquo;s over again this time
and I shall soon forget it altogether. I might just as well
begin to stop thinking about it now. It&rsquo;s this part of
London. It&rsquo;s like Banbury Park. The people are absolutely
awful. They take cycling lessons quite coolly. They are
not afraid of anybody. To them this part is the best bit
of North London. They are that sort of people. They are
all alike. All of them would dislike me. I should die of
being with them.
</p>

<p>
Why is it that no one seems to know what north London
is? They say it is healthy and open. Perhaps I shall meet
someone who feels like I do about it and would get ill and
<a id="page-147" class="pagenum" title="147"></a>
die there. It is not imagination. It is a real feeling that
comes upon me....
</p>

<p>
The north London omnibus reached the tide of the
Euston Road and pulled up at Portland Road station.
Miriam got out weak and ill. The first breath of the central
air revived her. Standing there, the omnibus looked like
any other omnibus. She crossed the road, averting her
eyes from the north-going roads on either side of the church
and got into the inmost corner of another bus. She wanted
to ride about, getting from bus to bus, inside London
until her misery had passed. Opposite her was a stout
woman in a rusty bonnet and shawl and dust-defaced black
skirt, looking about with eyes that did not see what they
looked at, all the London consciousness in her. Miriam
sat gazing at her. The woman&rsquo;s eyes crossed her and passed
unperturbed....
</p>

<p>
The lane of little shops flowed away, their huddled detail
crushing together, wide shop windows glittered steadily
by and narrowed away. When the bus stopped at Gower
Street the spire of St. Pancras church came into sight
spindling majestically up, screened by trees.
</p>

<p>
The trees in Endsleigh Gardens came along gently waving
their budding branches in bright sunshine. The colour of
the gardens was so intense that the sun must just be going
to set behind Euston Station. The large houses moved
steadily behind the gardens in blocks, bright white, with
large quiet streets opening their vistas in between the blocks,
leading to green freshness and then safely on down into
Soho. The long square came to an end. The shrub-trimmed
base of St. Pancras church came heavily nearer
and stopped. As Miriam got out of the bus she watched
its great body rise in clear sharp outline against the blue.
Its clock was booming the hour out across the gardens
through the houses and down into the squares. On this
side its sound was broken up by the narrow roar of the Euston
Road and the clamour coming right and left from the two
great stations.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-148" class="pagenum" title="148"></a>
Her feet tramped happily across the square of polished
roadway patterned with shadows and along the quiet clean
sunlit pavement behind the gardens. It was always bright
and clean and quiet and happy there, like the pavement
of a road behind a sea-front. The sound of a mail van
rattling heavily along Woburn Place changed to a soft
rumble as she turned in between the great houses of Tansley
Street and walked along its silent corridor of afternoon
light. Sparrows were cheeping in the stillness. To be
able to go down the quiet street and on into the squares&mdash;on
a bicycle.... I must learn somehow to get my balance.
To go along, like in that moment when he took his hands
off the handle-bars, in knickers and a short skirt and all the
summer to come.... Everything shone with a greater
intensity. Friends and thought and work were nothing
compared to being able to ride alone, balanced, going along
through the air.
</p>

<p>
On the hall table was a post-card. &ldquo;Come round on
Sunday if you&rsquo;re in town&mdash;Irlandisches Ragout. Mag.&rdquo;
Her heart stirred; that settled it&mdash;the girls wanted
her; Mag wanted her. She took Alma&rsquo;s crumpled
letter from her pocket and glanced through it once more
... &ldquo;such a dull Sunday and all your fault. Why
did you not come? Come on Saturday <em>any</em> time or
Sunday morning if you can&rsquo;t manage the week-end?&rdquo;
What a good thing she had not written promising to
go. She would be in London, safe in Kennett Street for
Sunday. Mag was quite right; going away unsettled
you for the week and you did not <em>get</em> Sunday. She
looked at her watch, five-thirty; in half an hour the
girls would probably be at Slater&rsquo;s; the London week-end
could begin this minute; all the people who half-expected
her, the Brooms, the Pernes, Sarah and Harriett, the Wilsons,
would be in their homes far away; she safe in Bloomsbury,
in the big house the big kind streets, Kennett Street;
places they none of them knew; safe for the whole length
of the week-end. Saturday had looked so obstructed, with
<a id="page-149" class="pagenum" title="149"></a>
the cycling lesson, and the visit to Miss Szigmondy and the
many alternatives for the rest of the time.... &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ve
got about <em>fifty</em> engagements for Saturday&rdquo; and now Saturday
was clear and she felt equal to anything for the week-end.
What a discovery, standing hidden, there in the
London house, to drop everything and go down, with all
the discarded engagements, all the solicitous protecting
friends put aside; easy and alone through the glimmering
green squares to the end of the Strand and find Slater&rsquo;s....
I&rsquo;ll never stir out of London again. The girls are
right. It isn&rsquo;t worth it.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-9-2">

<p class="noindent">
She saw the girls seated at a table at the far end of the
big restaurant and shyly advanced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hulloh child!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What you having?&rdquo; she asked sitting down opposite
to them. The empty white table-cloth shone under a
brilliant incandescent light; far away down the vista the
door opened on the daylit street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a glorious Spring evening?&rdquo; Spring? It was,
of course. Everyone had been saying the spring would
never come, but to-day it was very warm. Spring was here
of course. Perspiring in a dusty cycling school and sitting
in a hot restaurant was not spring. Spring was somewhere
far away. Going to stay and talk in people&rsquo;s houses did not
bring Spring&mdash;landscapes belonging to people were <em>painted</em>;
you must be alone ... or perhaps at the Brooms. Perhaps
next week-end at the Brooms would be in time for the
spring; in their back garden, the watered green lawn and
the sweetbriar and the distant trees in the large garden
beyond the fence. In London it was better not to think
about the times of year.
</p>

<p>
But Mag seemed to find Spring in London. Her face
was all glowing with the sense of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What you having?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you observed with what a remarkable brilliance
<a id="page-150" class="pagenum" title="150"></a>
the tender green shines out against the soot-black branches?&rdquo;
Yes, that was wonderful but what was the joke?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every spring I have spent in Lonndonn I have heard
that remark at least fifty times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam laughed politely. &ldquo;Jan, <em>what</em> have you ordered?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve ordered beef my child, cold beefs and salads.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think I should like salad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you <em>had</em> a brother would he like salad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do they put dressing on it? If I could have just plain
lettuce.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ask for it my child, ask and it shall be given unto thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A waitress brought the beef and salad, two glasses with
an inch of whisky in each, and a large syphon.
</p>

<p>
Miriam ordered beef and potatoes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose the steak and onion days are over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t have another steak and onions, please God,
until next November.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam laughed delightedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you gone away for the week-end, child?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told you she wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I wanted to come down here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that a compliment to us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;ve had a bicycle lesson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both faces came up eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You remember; that extraordinary woman I met at
the Royal Institution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The faces looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh you know; I <em>told</em> you about it&mdash;the two lessons
she didn&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on my child; we remember; go on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam sat eating her beef.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on Miriam. You&rsquo;ve really had a lesson. I&rsquo;m
delighted my child. Tell us all about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember the extraordinary moment when you
felt the machine going along; even with the man holding
the handle-bars?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wait until there&rsquo;s nobody to hold the handlebars.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-151" class="pagenum" title="151"></a>
&ldquo;Have you been out alone yet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two faces looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall we tell her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You <em>must</em> tell me; es ist bestimmt in Gottes Rath.&rdquo;
They leaned across the table and spoke low one after
the other. &ldquo;We went out&mdash;last night&mdash;after dark&mdash;and
rode&mdash;round Russell Square&mdash;twice&mdash;in our knickers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>No.</em> Did you really? How simply heavenly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It <em>was</em>. We came home nearly crying with rage at not
being able to go about, permanently, in nothing but knickers.
It would make life an <em>absolutely</em> different thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The freedom of movement.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. You feel like a sprite you are so light.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And like a poet though you don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You feel like a sprite you are so light, and you feel so
strong and capable and so broadshouldered you could knock
down a policeman. Jan and I knocked down several last
night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; and it is not only that; think of never having
to brush your skirt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know. It would be bliss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I spend half my life brushing my skirt. If I miss a
day I notice it&mdash;if I miss two days the office notices it. If
I miss three days the public notices it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;La vie est dure; pour les femmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be a man Jan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh I do, sometimes. They have the best of everything
all round.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>I</em> don&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t be a man for anything. I wouldn&rsquo;t
have a man&rsquo;s&mdash;<em>consciousness</em>, for anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not asthore?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re too absolutely pig-headed and silly....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Isn&rsquo;t</em> she intolerant?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam sat flaring. That was not the right answer.
There was something; and they must know it; but they
would not admit it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you can both really ride?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-152" class="pagenum" title="152"></a>
&ldquo;We do nothing else; we&rsquo;ve given up walking; we no
longer walk up and downstairs; we ride.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam laughed her delight. &ldquo;I can quite understand;
it alters everything. I realised that this afternoon at the
school. To be able to bicycle would make life utterly
different; on a bicycle you feel a different person; nothing
can come near you, you forget who you are. Aren&rsquo;t you
glad you are alive to-day, when all these things are
happening?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What things little one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well cycling and things. You know girls when I&rsquo;m
thirty I&rsquo;m going to cut my hair short and wear divided
skirts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both faces came up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t face doing my hair and brushing skirts and
keeping more or less in the fashion, that means about two
years behind because I never realise fashions till they&rsquo;re
just going, even if I could afford to,&mdash;all my life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why not do it now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because all my friends and relatives would object. It
would worry them too&mdash;they would feel quite sure then I
should never marry&mdash;and they still entertain hopes, secretly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to marry&mdash;ever; ever?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;it would mean giving up this life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know. I agree there. That can&rsquo;t be faced.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should think <em>not</em>. Aren&rsquo;t you going to have any
pudding?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why thirty? Why not thirty-one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because nobody cares what you do when you&rsquo;re thirty;
they&rsquo;ve all given up hope by that time. Aren&rsquo;t you two
going to have any pudding?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. But that is no reason why you should not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a good idea&mdash;to have just one dish and coffee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we think; and it&rsquo;s cheap.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t have had any dinner at all only I&rsquo;m
cadging dinner with you to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-153" class="pagenum" title="153"></a>
&ldquo;What would you have done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An egg, at an A.B.C.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How fond you are of A.B.C&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I love them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it that you love about them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chiefly I think their dowdiness. The food is honest;
not showy, and they are so blissfully dowdy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both girls laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good. I have come to the conclusion I like
dowdiness. I&rsquo;m not smart. You are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the first we have heard of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well you know you are. You keep in the fashion. It
may be quite right, perhaps you are more sociable than I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One is so conspicuous if one is not dressed more or less
like other people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I hate; dressing like other people. If I
could afford it I should be stylish&mdash;not smart. Perfect
coats and skirts and a few good evening dresses. But you
must be awfully well off for that. If I can&rsquo;t be stylish I&rsquo;d
rather be dowdy and in a way I like dowdiness even better
than stylishness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girls laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t clothes awful, anyhow? I&rsquo;ve spent four
and eleven on my knickers and I can&rsquo;t possibly get a skirt
till next year if then, or afford to hire a machine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask them to raise your salary?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After four months? Besides any fool could do the
work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I were you I should tell them. I should say &lsquo;Gentlemen&mdash;I
wish for a skirt and a bicycle.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mag, don&rsquo;t be so silly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> see it. <em>They</em> would benefit by your improved
health and spirits. Jan and I are new women since we have
learned riding. <em>I</em> am thinking of telling the governor I
must have a rise to meet the increased demands of my
appetite. Our housekeeping expenses I shall say are doubled.
What <em>will</em> you? Que faire?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-154" class="pagenum" title="154"></a>
&ldquo;You see the work I&rsquo;m doing is not worth more than a
pound a week&mdash;my languages are no good there. I suppose
I ought to learn typing and shorthand; but where could
I find the money for the training?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you teach her shorthand if I teach her typing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly if the child wants to learn. I don&rsquo;t advise
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not Jan. <em>You</em> did. How long would it take me in
evenings?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A year at least, to be marketable. It&rsquo;s a vile thing to
learn, unless you are thoroughly stupid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Jan was a perfect fool. The more
intelligent you are the longer you take.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see it isn&rsquo;t a language. It is an arbitrary system
of signs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With your intelligence you&rsquo;d probably grow grey at the
school. Wouldn&rsquo;t she, Jan?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Besides I can&rsquo;t imagine Mistress Miriam in an office.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody would have me. I&rsquo;m not business-like enough.
I am learning book-keeping at their expense. And don&rsquo;t
forget they give me lunch and tea. I say are we going to
read &lsquo;The Evolution Idea of God&rsquo; to-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Let&rsquo;s get back and get our clothes off. If I
don&rsquo;t have a cigarette within half an hour I shall die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, so shall I. I had forgotten the existence of
cigarettes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Out in the street Miriam felt embarrassed. The sunset
glow broke through wherever there was a gap towards the
north-west, and flooded a strip of the street and struck a
building. The presence of the girls added a sharpness to
its beauty, especially the presence of Mag who felt the
spring even in London. But both of them seemed entirely
oblivious. They marched along at a great rate, very upright
and swift&mdash;like grenadiers&mdash;why grenadiers? Like
grenadiers, making her hurry in a way that increased the
discomfort of her hard cheap down-at-heel shoes. Their
<a id="page-155" class="pagenum" title="155"></a>
high-heeled shoes were in perfect condition and they went
on and on laughing and jesting as if there were no spring
evening all round them. She wanted to stroll, and stop
at every turn of the road. She grew to dislike them both
long before Kennett Street was reached, their brisk gait
as they walked together in step, leaving her to man&oelig;uvre
the passing of pedestrians on the narrow pavements of the
side streets, the self-confident set of their this-season&rsquo;s
clothes, &ldquo;line&rdquo; clothes, like everyone else was wearing,
everyone this side of the west-end; Oxford Street clothes
... and to long to be wandering home alone through the
leafy squares. Were people who lived together always like
this, always brisk and joking and keeping it up? They
got on so well together ... and she got on so well too
with them. &ldquo;No one ever feels a third&rdquo; Mag had said.
I am tired, too tired. They are stronger than I am. I
feel dead; and they are perfectly fresh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know I believe I feel too played out to read&rdquo;
she said at their door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then come in and smoke&rdquo; said Mag taking her arm.
&ldquo;The night is yet young.&rdquo;

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">iriam</span> swung her legs from the table and brought
her tilted chair to the ground. The leads sloped
down as she got to her feet and the strip of sky disappeared.
The sunlight made a broad strip of gold along the parapet
and a dazzling plaque upon the slope of the leads. She
lounged into the shadowy middle of the room and stood
feeling tall and steady and easy and agile in the freedom
of knickers. The clothes lying on the bed were transformed.
&ldquo;I say&rdquo; she murmured. Her cigarette end
wobbling encouragingly from the corner of her lips as she
spoke, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not bad.&rdquo; She strolled about the room
glancing at them from different points of view. They
really made quite a good whole. It was the lilac that made
them a good whole, the fresh heavy blunt cones of pure
colour. In the distance the bunched ribbon looked almost
all green. She drew the hat nearer to the light and the
ribbon became mauve with green shadows and green with
mauve shadows as it moved. The girl had been right about
bunching the ribbon a little way up the sugar-loaf and
over the wide brim. It broke the papery stiffness of the
lilac and the harshness of the black straw. The straw looked
very harsh and black in the clearer light. Out of doors
it would look almost as if it had been done with that awful
shiny hat polish. If the straw had been dull and silky and
some shaded tone of mauve and green it would have been
one of those hats that give you a sort of madness, taking
your eyes in and in, with the effect of a misty distant
woodland brought near and moving, depths of interwoven
<a id="page-157" class="pagenum" title="157"></a>
colour under your eyes. But it would not have gone with
the black and white check. The black part of the hat
was right for the tiny check. That is the idea of some
smart woman.... I did not think of it in the shop, but
I got it right somehow, I can see now. It&rsquo;s right. Those
might be someone else&rsquo;s things.... The sight of the black
suède gloves and the lace-edged handkerchief and the
powder box laid out on the chest of drawers made her
eager to begin. This was dressing. The way to feel you
were dressing was to put everything out first and come
back as another person and make a grand toilet. It makes
you feel free and leisurely. There had been the long
strange morning. In half an hour the adventure would
begin and go on and be over. The room would not be
in it. Something nice or horrible would come back. But
the room would not be changed.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
She found the dark green Atlas &rsquo;bus standing ready by
the curb and waited until it was just about to start, looking
impatiently up and down the long vistas of the empty
Sunday street, and then jumped hurriedly in with the
polite half-irritated resignation of the man about town
who finds himself stranded in a godforsaken part of London,
and steered herself carefully against the swaying of the
vehicle along between the rows of seated forms, keeping
her eyes carefully averted and fixed upon distant splendours.
Securing an empty corner she sat down provisionally, on
the edge of the seat, occupying the least possible space,
clear of her neighbour, her eyes turned inwards on splendours
still raking the street, her person ready to leap up at the
sight of a crawling hansom&mdash;telling herself in a drawl
that she felt must somehow be audible to an observant
listener how damnable it was that there were not hansoms
in these remarkable backwoods&mdash;so damned inconvenient
when your own barrow is laid up at Windover&rsquo;s. But a
<a id="page-158" class="pagenum" title="158"></a>
hansom might possibly appear.... She turned to the
little corner window at her side and gazed with fierce
abstraction down the on-coming street. Presently she
would really be in a hansom. Miss Szigmondy had mentioned
hansoms ... supposing she should have to pay
her share? Her heart beat rapidly and her face flushed
as she thought of the fourpence in her purse. She would
not be able even to offer. But if Miss Szigmondy were
alone she would take cabs. There would be no need to
mention it. The ambling trit-trot of the vehicle gradually
prevailed over the mood in which she had dressed. She
was becoming aware of her companions. Presently she
would be taking them all in and getting into a world that
had nothing to do with her afternoon. Turning aside
so that her face could not be seen and her own vision
might be restricted to the roadway rolling slowly upon her
through the little end window she dreamed of contriving
somehow or other to save money for hansoms. Hansoms
were a necessary part of the worldly life. Floating about
in a hansom in the west-end, in the season was like nothing
else in the world. It changed you, your feelings, manner,
bearing, everything. It made you part of a wonderful
exclusive difficult triumphant life, a streak of it, going
in and out. It cut you off from all personal difficulties,
made you drop your personality and lifted you right out
into the freedom of a throng of happy people, a great
sunlit tide singing, all the same laughing song, wave after
wave, advancing, in open sunlight. It took you on to a
great stage, lit and decked, where you were lost, everything
was lost and forgotten in the masque. Nothing personal
could matter so long as you were there and kept there,
day and night. Everyone was invisible and visionless,
united in the spectacle, gilding and hiding the underworld
in a brilliant embroidery ... continuously.
</p>

<p>
As they rumbled up Baker Street, she wondered impatiently
why Miss Szigmondy had not appointed a meeting
place in the West end. Baker Street began all right; one
<a id="page-159" class="pagenum" title="159"></a>
felt safe going up Orchard Street, past the beautiful china
shop and the Romish richness of Burns and Oates, seeing
the sequestered worldliness of Granville Place and rolling
through Portman Square with its enormous grey houses
masking hidden wealth; but after that it became a dismal
corridor retreating towards the full chill of the north.
If they had met in Piccadilly they could have driven
straight down through heaven into Chelsea. Perhaps it
would not be heaven with Miss Szigmondy. She would
not know the difference in the feeling of the different
parts of London. She would drive along like a foreigner&mdash;or
a member of a provincial antiquarian society, &ldquo;intelligently&rdquo;
noticing things, knowing about the buildings and
the statues. Londoners were always twitted with not
knowing about London ... the reason why they jested
about it, half proudly, was their consciousness of being
Londoners, living in London, going about happy, the
minute they were outside their houses, looking at nothing
and feeling everything, like people wandering happily from
room to room in a well known house at some time when
everybody&rsquo;s attention was turned away by a festival or a
catastrophe.... London was like a prairie. In a hansom
it would be heaven, with anybody. A hansom saved you
from your companion more than any other vehicle. You
were as much outside it in London as you were inside with
your companion, if you were anywhere south of Marylebone
... the way the open hood framed the vista....
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-10-3">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
There was a hansom waiting outside Miss Szigmondy&rsquo;s
garden gate. The afternoon would begin at once with a
swift drive back into the world. Miss Szigmondy met
her in the dark hall, with an outbreak of bright guttural
talk, talking as she collected her things, breaking in with
shouted instructions to an invisible servant. Her voice
sounded very foreign in the excited upper notes, but it
<a id="page-160" class="pagenum" title="160"></a>
rang, a thin wiry ring, not shrieking and breaking like the
voices of excited Englishwomen, perhaps that was &ldquo;voice
production.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In the cab she sat sorting her cards, reading out names.
Miriam thrilled as she heard them. Miss Szigmondy&rsquo;s
attention was no longer on her. Her mind slipped easily
back; the intervening time fell away. She was going with
her sisters along past the Burlington Arcade, she saw the
pillar box, the old man selling papers, the old woman with
the crooked black sailor hat and the fringed shawl, sitting
on a box behind her huge basket of tulips and daffodils
... the great grimed stone pillars, the court yard beyond
them blazing with sunshine, the wide stone steps at the far
end of the court yard leading up into cool shadow, the
turnstile and great hall, an archway, and the sudden fresh
blaze of colours....
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But the hansom had turned into the main road and was
going <em>north</em>. They were going even further north than
Miss Szigmondy&rsquo;s ... up a straight empty Sunday suburban
road between rows of suburban houses with gardens that
tried to look pretty ... an open silly prettiness like suburban
ladies coming up to town for matinées ... if there were
artists living up here it would not be worth while to go and
see them....
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-10-4">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
As the afternoon wore on it dawned upon Miriam that
if Miss Szigmondy were to be at the poet&rsquo;s house in evening
dress by half past six, they had seen nearly all they were
going to see. There could be no thought of Chelsea.
But she answered with a swift negative when Miss Szigmondy
enquired as they were shown into their hansom
outside their eighth large Hampstead house whether she
were tired. Her unsatisfied consciousness ran ahead, waiting;
just beyond, round the next corner was something
that would relieve the oppression. &ldquo;I just want to <a id="rgun"></a>rgun
<a id="page-161" class="pagenum" title="161"></a>
in and see that poor boy Gilbert Haze.&rdquo; Then it was over
and she must go on enduring whilst Miss Szigmondy paid
a call; unable to get free because she was being paid for
and could not afford to go back alone. They drove for
some distance, the large houses disappeared, they were in
amongst little drab roadways like those round about Mornington
Road. Perhaps if she improvised an engagement
she could find her way to Regent&rsquo;s Park and get back. But
they had come so far. They must be on the outskirts of
N.W., perhaps even in N. They pulled up before a small
drab villa. The sun had gone behind the clouds, the short
street was desolate. No touch of life or colour anywhere,
hardly a sign of spring in the small parched shrub-filled
front gardens, uniformly enclosed by dusty railings. She
dreaded her wait alone in the cab with her finery and her
empty afternoon while Miss Szigmondy visited her sick
friend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Miss Szigmondy from the little
garden path &ldquo;poor <a id="cgeature"></a>cgeature you <em>do</em> look tired.&rdquo; Miriam
got angrily out of the cab. Whose fault was it that she
was tired? Why did Miss Szigmondy go to these things?
She had not cared and was not disappointed at not caring.
She was just the same as when she had started out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will wait in the garden&rdquo; she said hurriedly as the door
opened on the house of sickness. A short young man with
untidy dark hair and a shabby suit stood in the doorway.
His brilliant dark eyes smiled sharply at Miss Szigmondy
and shot beyond her towards Miriam as he stood aside holding
the door wide. &ldquo;Come along&rdquo; shouted Miss Szigmondy
disappearing. Miriam came reluctantly forward
and got herself through the door, reaping the second
curious sharp smile as she passed. The young man had an
extraordinary face, cheerful and grimy, like a street arab;
he was rather like a street arab. Miss Szigmondy was talking
loudly from a little room to the right of the door.
Miriam&rsquo;s embarrassment in the impossibility of explaining
her own superfluous presence was not relieved when she
<a id="page-162" class="pagenum" title="162"></a>
entered the room. The young man was clearly not prepared.
It was a most unwarrantable intrusion. She stood
at a loss behind Miss Szigmondy who was planted, still
eagerly talking, on the small clear space of bare boards&mdash;cracked
and dusty, like a warehouse&mdash;in the middle of the
room and tried not to see anything in particular; but her
eyes already had the sense that there was nothing to sit
upon, no corner to retire into, nothing but an extraordinary
confusion of shabby dust-covered things laid bare by the
sunlight that poured through the uncurtained window.
Her eyes took refuge in the face of the young man confronting
Miss Szigmondy, making replies to her volley of
questions. He had no front teeth, nothing but blackened
stumps; dreadful, one ought not to look, unless he were
going to be helped. Perhaps Miss Szigmondy was going
to help him. But he did not look ill. His bright glancing
eyes shot about as if looking at something that was not
there and he answered Miss Szigmondy&rsquo;s sallies with a sort
of cheerful convulsion of his whole frame. He seemed to
be &ldquo;on wires&rdquo;; but not weak; strong and cheerful;
happy; a kind of cheerfulness and happiness she had
never met before. It was quiet. It came from him soundlessly
making within his pleasant voice a gay noise that
conquered the strange embarrassing room. Presently in
answer to a demand from Miss Szigmondy he opened
folding doors and ushered them into an adjoining room.

<p class="noindent">
Miriam stood holding the little group in her hands
longing for words. She could only smile and smile. The
young man stood by looking at it and smiling, too, giving
his attention to Miss Szigmondy&rsquo;s questions about some
larger white things standing in the bare room. When he
moved away towards these and she could leave off wondering
whether it would do to say &ldquo;and is this really going to
the Academy next week&rdquo; instead of again repeating &ldquo;how
<a id="page-163" class="pagenum" title="163"></a>
beautiful,&rdquo; and her eye could run undisturbed over and
over the outlines of the two horses, impressions crowded
upon her. The thing moved and changed as she looked
at it; it seemed as if it must break away, burst out of her
hands into the surrounding atmosphere. Everything about
took on a happy familiarity, as if she had long been in the
bright bare plaster-filled little room. From the edges of
the small white group a radiance spread freshening the
air, flowing out into the happy world, flowing back
over the afternoon, bringing parts of it to stand out
like great fresh bright Academy pictures. The great
studios opening out within the large garden-draped Hampstead
houses rich and bright with colour in a golden light,
their fur rugs and tea services on silver trays, and velvet
coated men, wives with trailing dresses and the people
standing about, at once conspicuous and lost, were like
Academy pictures. It was all real now, the pictures on the
great easels, scraps of the Academy blaze; the studio with
the bright light, and marble, and bright clear tiger skins
on the floor, the big clean fresh tiger almost filling the
canvas ... the dark studio with antique furniture and
pictures of people standing about in historical clothes....

your salary?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you really like them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve never seen you look so nice. You ought
always to go about in a large black hat trimmed with lilac.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t one of the artists want to paint your portrait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They all did. I&rsquo;ve promised at least twenty sittings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come nearer to the lamp fair child that I may be even
more dazzled by thy splendour.&rdquo;
</p>

<a id="page-164" class="pagenum" title="164"></a>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad you like them&mdash;they&rsquo;ll have to go
on for ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where on earth did you find the money child?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Borrowed it from Harry. It was her idea. You see
I shall get four pounds for my four weeks&rsquo; holiday; and if
I go to stay with them it won&rsquo;t cost me anything; so she
advanced me two pounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you got all this for two pounds?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Practically; the hat was ten and six and the other
things twenty seven and six and the gloves half a crown.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where did you get them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Edgware Road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And just put them on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is really remarkable. Do you realise how lucky
you are in being a stock size?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I am. But you know the awful thing about
it is that they will never come in for Wimpole Street.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth not? What could be more ladylike,
more&mdash;simple, more altogether suitable?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see I have to wear black there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What an extraordinary idea. <em>Why?</em>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well they asked me to. I don&rsquo;t know. I believe it&rsquo;s
the fault of my predecessor. They told me she <em>rustled</em>
and wore all kinds of dresses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see&mdash;a series of explosions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On silk foundations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why should they assume that you would do the
same?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s an awful nuisance. You can&rsquo;t get
black blouses that will wash; it will be awful in the
summer; besides it&rsquo;s so unbecoming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There I can&rsquo;t agree. It would be for me. It makes
me look dingy; but it suits you, throws up your rose-leaf
complexion and your golden hair. But I call it jolly hard
lines. I&rsquo;d like to see the governor dictating to me what I
should wear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so expensive if one can&rsquo;t wear out one&rsquo;s best things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-165" class="pagenum" title="165"></a>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s intolerable. Why do you stand it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell them you must either wear <em>scarlet</em> at the office
or have a higher <em>screw</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t an office you see. I have to be so much in the
surgeries and interviewing people in the waiting-room, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;from dukes to dustmen. But would either the
dukes or the dustmen disapprove of scarlet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One has to be a discreet nobody. It&rsquo;s the professional
world; you don&rsquo;t understand; you are equals, you two,
superiors, pampered countesses in your offices.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I think it&rsquo;s a beastly shame. I should brandish
a pair of forceps at Mr. Hancock and say &lsquo;scarlet&mdash;or I
leave.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where should I go? I have no qualifications.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t leave. They would say &lsquo;Miss Henderson
wear purple and yellow, only stay.&rsquo; I think it&rsquo;s a reflection
on her taste, don&rsquo;t you Jan?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly it is. It is fiendish. But employers <em>are</em> fiends&mdash;to
women.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t found that soh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah you keep yours in order, you rule them with a rod of
iron.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do. I believe in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I envy you your late hours in the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah-ha&mdash;she&rsquo;s had a row about that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Have</em> you Mag?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a row; simply a discussion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simply this. The governor begged me&mdash;almost in
tears&mdash;to come down earlier&mdash;for the sake of the discipline
of the office.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said Herr <em>Epstein</em>; what can I do? How do you
suppose I can get up, have breakfast and be down here
before eleven?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-166" class="pagenum" title="166"></a>
&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He protested and implored and offered to pay cabs for
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good Lord Mag, you are extraordinary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not extraordinary and it is no concern of the
Deity&rsquo;s. I fail to see why I should get to the office earlier
than I do. I don&rsquo;t get my letters before half-past eleven.
I am fresh and gay and rested, I get through my work before
closing-time. I work like anything whilst I am there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you still go down at eleven?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I still go down at eleven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <em>do</em> envy you. You see my people always want me most
first thing in the morning. It&rsquo;s awful, if one has been up
very late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what is our life worth without late hours? The
evening is the only life we have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. And they are the same really. They do their
work to be free of it and live.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely; but they are waited on. They have their
houses and baths and servants and meals and comforts.
We get up in cold rooms untended and tired. <em>They</em> ought
to be first at the office and wait upon us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is a queen in her office; waited upon hand and
foot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;why not? I do them the honour of bringing
my bright petunia clad feminine presence into their dingy
warehouse; I expect some acknowledgment of the honour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t allow them either to spit or swear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not; and they appreciate it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mine are beasts. I defy anyone to do anything with
them. I <em>loathe</em> the city man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam sighed. In neither of these offices she felt
sure, could she hold her own&mdash;and yet compared to her
own long day&mdash;what freedom the girls had&mdash;ten to five
and eleven to six and any clothes they found it convenient
to wear. But city men ... no restrictions were too high
a price to pay for the privileges of her environment; the
<a id="page-167" class="pagenum" title="167"></a>
association with gentlemen, her quiet room, the house,
the perpetual interest of the patients, the curious exciting
streaks of social life, linking up with the past and carrying
the past forward on a more generous level. The girls had
broken with the past and were fighting in the world. She
was somehow between two worlds, neither quite sheltered,
nor quite free ... not free as long as she wanted, in spite
of her reason to stay on at Wimpole Street and please the
people there. Why did she want to stay? What future
would it bring? Less than ever was there any chance of
saving for old age. She could not for ever go on being
secretary to a dentist.... She drove these thoughts away;
they were only one side of the matter; there were other
things; things she could not make clear to the girls; nor
to anyone who could not see and feel the whole thing from
inside, as she saw and felt it. And even if it were not so,
if the environment of her poorly paid activities had been
trying and unsympathetic, at least it gave seclusion, her own
room to work in, her free garret and her evening and week-end
freedom. But what was she going to do with it?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell us about the <em>show</em>, Miriam. Cease to gaze at Jan&rsquo;s
relations; sit down, light a cigarette.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These German women fascinate me,&rdquo; said Miriam
swinging round from the mantelshelf; &ldquo;they are so like
Jan and so utterly different.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; Jan is Jan and they are Minna and Erica.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Taking a cigarette from Mag&rsquo;s case Miriam lit it at the
lamp. Before her eyes the summer unrolled&mdash;concerts
with Miss Szigmondy, going in the cooling day in her new
clothes, with a thin blouse, from daylight into electric
light and music, taking off the zouave inside and feeling
cool at once, the electric light mixing with the daylight,
the cool darkness to walk home in alone, full of music
that would last on into the next day; Miss Szigmondy&rsquo;s
musical at homes, evenings at Wimpole Street, week-ends
in the flowery suburbs windows and doors open, cool rooms,
gardens in the morning and evening, week-ends in the
<a id="page-168" class="pagenum" title="168"></a>
country, each journey like the beginning of the summer
holiday, week-ends in town, Sunday afternoons at Mr.
Hancock&rsquo;s and Miss Szigmondy&rsquo;s&mdash;all taking her away from
Kennett Street. All these things yielded their best reality
in this room. Glowing brightly in the distance they made
this room like the centre of a song. But a week-end taken
up was a week-end missed at Kennett Street. It meant
missing Slater&rsquo;s on Saturday night, the week end stretching
out ahead immensely long, the long evening with the girls,
its lateness protected by the coming Sunday, waking lazily
fresh and happy and easy-minded on Sunday morning,
late breakfast, the cigarette in the sunlit window space,
its wooden sides echoing with the clamour of St. Pancras
bells, the three voices in the little rooms, irlandisches ragout,
the hours of smoking and talking out and out on to strange
promontories where everything was real all the time, the
faint gradual coming of the twilight, the evening untouched
by the presence of Monday, no hurry ahead, no social
performances, no leave-taking, no railway journey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; <a id="corr-45"></a>Jan is Londonised; she looks German; her
voice suggests the whole of Germany; these girls are Germany
untouched, strong, cheerful, musical, tree-filled
Germany, without any doubts. They&rsquo;ve got Jan&rsquo;s sense of
humour without her cynicism.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that so, Jan?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes I think perhaps it is. They are sweet simple
children.&rdquo; Yes sweet&mdash;but maddening too. German
women were so sure and unsuspicious and practical about
life. Jan had some of that left. But she was English too,
more transparent and thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The show! The show!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She told them the story of the afternoon in a glowing
précis, calling up the splendours upon which she felt their
imaginations at work, describing it as they saw it and as
with them, in retrospect, she saw it herself. Her descriptions
drew Mag&rsquo;s face towards her, glowing, wrapt and
reverent. Jan sat sewing with inturned eyes and half open,
<a id="page-169" class="pagenum" title="169"></a>
half-smiling appreciative face. They both fastened upon
the great gold-framed pictures, asking for details. Presently
they were making plans to visit the Academy and foretelling
her joy in seeing them again and identifying them.
She had not thought of that; certainly, it would be delightful;
and perhaps seeing the pictures in freedom and
alone she might find them wonderful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you say their wives were all like cats?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They were.&rdquo; She called up the unhatted figures moving
about among the guests in trailing gowns,&mdash;keeping something
up, pretending to be interested, being cattishly nice
to the visitors, and thinking about other things all the
time.... I can&rsquo;t <em>stand</em> them, oh, I can&rsquo;t stand them....
But the girls would not have seen them in that way; they
would have been interested in them and their dresses, they
would have admired the prettiness of some of them and
found several of them &lsquo;charming&rsquo; ... if Mag were an
artist&rsquo;s wife she would behave in the way those women
behaved....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were they all <em>alike</em>?&rdquo; that was half sarcastic....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Absolutely. They were all <em>cats</em>, simply.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she <em>extraordinary</em>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the cats who are extraordinary. Why do they do
it girls! <em>Why</em> do they do it?&rdquo; She flushed feeling insincere.
At this moment she felt that she knew that Mag
in social life, would conform and be a cat. She had never
thought of her in social life; here in poverty and freedom
she was herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do <em>phwatt</em> me dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh let them go. It makes me tired, even to think of
them. The thought of the sound of their voices absolutely
wears me out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not laaazy&mdash;I&rsquo;m tie-erd&mdash;I was <em>born</em> tie-erd.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say girls, I want to ask you something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you two write?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Write?</em>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-170" class="pagenum" title="170"></a>
&ldquo;Write what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just as we are, without one&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Flea&mdash;I know. No. <em>Don&rsquo;t</em> be silly. I&rsquo;m perfectly
serious. I mean it. Why don&rsquo;t you write things&mdash;both
of you. I thought of it this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both girls sat thoughtful. It was evident that the idea
was not altogether unfamiliar to them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Someone kept telling me the other day I ought to
write and it suddenly struck me that if anyone ought it&rsquo;s
you two. Why don&rsquo;t you Mag?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I? Have I not already enough on my fair
young shoulders?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Jan</em>, why don&rsquo;t <em>you</em>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I, my dear? For a most excellent reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What reason?&rdquo; demanded Miriam in a shaking voice.
Her heart was beating; she felt that a personal decision
was going to be affected by Jan&rsquo;s reason, if she could be got
to express it. Jan did not reply instantly and she found
herself hoping that nothing more would be said about
writing, that she might be free to go on cherishing the idea,
alone and unbiassed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not write&rdquo; said Jan slowly, &ldquo;because I am perfectly
convinced that anything I might write would be
mediocre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam&rsquo;s heart sank. If Jan, with all her German knowledge
and her wit and experience of two countries felt this,
it was probably much truer of herself. To think about
it, to dwell upon the things Mr. Wilson had said was simply
vanity. He had said <em>anyone</em> could learn to write. But he
was clever and ready to believe her clever in the same way,
and ready to take ideas from him. It was true she had
material, &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; as he called it, but she would not have
known it, if she had not been told. She could see it now,
as he saw it, but if she wrote at his suggestion, a borrowed
suggestion, there would be something false in it, clever
and false.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-171" class="pagenum" title="171"></a>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think Jan&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mag cheerfully. &ldquo;That
is an excellent reason and the true one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was true. But how could they speak so lightly and
cheerfully about writing ... the thing one had always
wanted to do, that everyone probably secretly wanted to
do, and the girls could give up the idea without a sigh.
They were right. It would be wrong to write mediocre
stuff. Why was she feeling so miserable? Of course
because neither of them had suggested that she should
write. They knew her better than Mr. Wilson and it never
occurred to them that she should write. That settled it.
But something moved despairingly in the void.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think it would be <em>wrong</em> to write mediocre
stuff?&rdquo; she asked huskily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would be worse than <em>wrong</em> child&mdash;it would be
foolish; it wouldn&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">E</span><span class="postfirstchar">verything</span> was ready for the two o&rsquo;clock patient.
There was no excuse for lingering any longer. Half
past one. Why did they not come up? On her way to
the door she opened the corner cupboard and stood near
the open door hungry, listening for footsteps on the basement
stairs, dusting and ranging the neat rows of bottles.
At the end of five minutes she went guiltily down. If he
had finished his lunch they would wonder why she had
lingered so long. If she had hurried down as soon as she
could no one would have known that she hoped to have
lunch alone. Now because she had waited deliberately
someone would read her guilt. She wished she were one
of those people who never tried to avoid anything. The
lunch-room door opened and closed as she reached the
basement stairs. James&rsquo;s cheerful footsteps clacked along&mdash;neat
high-heeled shoes&mdash;towards the kitchen. She had
taken something in. They were still at lunch, unconsciously,
just in the same way. No. She was glad she was
not one of those people who just went on&mdash;not avoiding
things....
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock was only just beginning his second course.
He must have lingered in the workshop.... He was helping
himself to condiments; Mr. Orly proffered the wooden
pepper mill; &ldquo;oh&mdash;thank you&rdquo;; he screwed it with an
air of embarrassed appreciativeness. There was a curious
fresh lively air of embarrassment in the room making a
stirring warmth in its cellar-like coolness. Miriam slipped
quietly into her place hoping she was not an interloper.
<a id="page-173" class="pagenum" title="173"></a>
At any rate everyone was too much engrossed to ponder
over her lateness. Mr. Orly was sitting with his elbows
on the table and his serviette crumpled in his hands, ready
to rise from the table, beaming mildness and waiting. Mrs.
Orly sat waiting and smiling with her elbows on the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mr. Orly gently as Miriam sat down, &ldquo;here
comes the clerical staff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam beamed and began her soup. It was James
waiting to-day too, with her singing manner; a happy day.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Orly asked a question in her happiest voice. They
were fixing a date.... They were going ... to a <em>theatre</em>
... together. Her astonished mind tried to make them
coalesce ... she saw them sitting in a row, two different
worlds confronted by one spectacle ... there was not a
scrap of any kind of performance that would strike them
both in the same way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Got anything on on Friday Miss Henderson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sudden question startled her. Had it been asked
twice? She answered, stammering, in amazed consciousness
of what was to follow and accepted the invitation in a
flood of embarrassment. Her delight and horror and
astonishment seemed to flow all over the table. Desperately
she tried to gather in all her emotions behind an
easy appreciative smile. She felt astonishment and dismay
coming out of her hair, swelling her hands, making her
clumsy with her knife and fork. Far away, beyond her
grasp was the sense she felt she ought to have, the sense
of belonging; socially. It was being offered. But something
or someone was fighting it. Always, everywhere
someone or something was fighting it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Orly had given a ghostly little chuckle. &ldquo;Like
dining at restaurants?&rdquo; he asked kindly and swiftly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we shall have the pleasure of initiating you.
Like caviare?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what it is&rdquo; said Miriam trying to
bring gladness into her voice.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-174" class="pagenum" title="174"></a>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;this is great. Caviare to the million eh?&mdash;oh,
I ought not to have put it like that, things one would
rather have said otherwise&mdash;no offence intended&mdash;none
taken I hope&mdash;don&rsquo;t yeh know really?&mdash;Sturgeon&rsquo;s roe,
y&rsquo;know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I know I don&rsquo;t like <em>roe</em>&rdquo; said Miriam gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chalk it up. Miss Henderson doesn&rsquo;t like roe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam flushed. Pressing back through her anger to
what had preceded she found inspiration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My education has been neglected.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite so, but now&rsquo;s your chance. Seize your opportunity;
carpe diem. See?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it was caviare, not carp&rdquo; said Mr. Hancock
quietly.
</p>

<p>
Was it a rescue, or a sacrifice to the embarrassing occasion?
She had never heard him jest with the Orlys. Mrs.
Orly chuckled gleefully, flashing out the smile that Miriam
loved. It took every line from her care-fashioned face and
lit it with a most extraordinary radiance. She had smiled
like that as a girl in response to the jests of her many
brothers ... her eyes were sweet; there was a perfect sweetness
in her somewhere.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bravo Hancock, that&rsquo;s a good one.... Ye gods and
fishes large and small listen to <em>that</em>&rdquo; he murmured half
turning towards the door.
</p>

<p>
The clattering of boots on the stone stairs was followed
by the rattling of the loose door knob and the splitting
open of the door. Mr. Leyton shot into the room searching
the party with a swift glance and taking his place in
the circle in a state of headlong silent volubility. By the
way he attacked his lunch it was clear he had a patient
waiting or imminent. It occurred to Miriam to wonder
why he did not always arrange his appointments round
about lunch-time ... but any such man&oelig;uvre would be
discovered and things would be worse than ever. Mr.
Orly watched quietly while he refused Mrs. Orly&rsquo;s offer to
ring for soup, devouring bread and butter until she should
<a id="page-175" class="pagenum" title="175"></a>
have carved for him,&mdash;and then extended his invitation
to his son.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, is this the annual?&rdquo; asked Mr. Leyton gruffly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the show?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear will you be so good as to inform Mr. Leyton
of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly Ro&rdquo; said Mrs. Orly trying to laugh
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to Hamlet Ley.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have the honour of begging Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s company
on the occasion of our visit, dinner included, to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the date?&rdquo; rapped Mr. Leyton with his tumbler
to his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The date, ascertained as suited to all present with the
exception of your lordship&mdash;oh my God, Ley&rdquo; sighed Mr.
Orly hiding his face in his serviette, his huge shoulders shaking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What have I done now?&rdquo; asked Mr. Leyton, gasping
after his long drink.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so silly Ley. You haven&rsquo;t answd fathez
queshun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I answer till I&rsquo;m told the <em>date</em>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, you can come any evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Friday</em>&rdquo; whispered Miriam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo; said Mr. Orly softly, emerging from his
serviette, &ldquo;a traitor in the camp?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Friday is it? Well, then it&rsquo;s pretty certain I <em>can&rsquo;t</em>
come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly Ley&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t any engagements.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Haven&rsquo;t I?</em> There&rsquo;s a sing-song at Headquarters
Friday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enough, my dear, enough, press him no more&rdquo; said
Mr. Orly rising. &ldquo;Far be it from us to compete. Going
to sing Ley or to song, eh? Never mind boy, sorry you
can&rsquo;t come&rdquo; he added, sighing gustily as he left the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to come Ley won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; whispered
Mrs. Orly impatiently lingering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d only let me know the date beforehand instead
of springing it on me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-176" class="pagenum" title="176"></a>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be si&rsquo;y Ley it vexes Father so. You needn&rsquo;t
go to the si&rsquo;y sing-song.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can get out of it. It&rsquo;s rather a big
function; as an officer I ought to be there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh never mind; you&rsquo;d better come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Orly called from the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right darling&rdquo; she said in anxious cheerful level
tones hurrying to the door. &ldquo;You <em>must</em> come Ley, you
can manage somehow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam sat feeling wretchedly about in her mind. Mr.
Leyton was busily finishing his lunch. In a moment Mr.
Hancock would re-assert himself by some irrelevant insincerity.
She found courage to plunge into speech, on
the subject of her two lessons at the school. Her story
strove strangely against the echoes and fell, impeded. It
was an attempt to create a quiet diversion.... It should
have been done violently ... how many times had she
seen it done, the speaker violently pushing off what had
gone before and protruding his diversion, in brisk animated
deliberately detached tones. But it was never really any
good. There was always a break and a wound, something
left unhealed, something standing unlearned ... something
that can only grow clear in silence....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never learn cycling like <em>that</em>&rdquo; said Mr. Leyton
with the superior chuckle of the owner of a secret, as he
snatched up a biscuit and made off. She clung fearfully
to his cheerful harassed departing form. There was nothing
left now in the room but the echoes. Mr. Hancock sat
munching his biscuits and cheese with a look of determined
steely preoccupation in his eyes that were not raised above the
level of the spread of disarray along the table; but she
could hear the busy circulation of his thoughts. If now
she could endure for a moment. But her mind flung
hither and thither seeking with a loathed servility some
alien neutral topic. She knew anything she might say with
the consciousness of his thoughts in her mind would be
resented and slain. To get up and go quietly away with
<a id="page-177" class="pagenum" title="177"></a>
some murmured remark about her work would be to leave
him with his judgment upon him. What he wanted was
to give her an instruction about something in a detached
professional voice and get rid of her, believing that she had
gone unknowing, and remaining in his circle of reasonable
thoughts. She hit out with all her force, coming against
the buttress of silent angry forehead with random speech.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s less than two months to the
longest day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Time flies&rdquo; responded Mr. Hancock grimly. She
recoiled exhausted by her effort and quailed under the
pang in the midday gaslit room of realisation of the meaning
of her words. Her eye swept over the grey-clad form
and the blunted features seeking some power that would
stay the inexorable consumption of the bright passing days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tempus fugit&rsquo; I suppose one ought to say&rdquo; he said
with a little laugh getting up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oui,&rdquo; said Miriam angrily, &ldquo;le temps s&rsquo;envole; die
Zeit vergeht, in other words.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">R</span><span class="postfirstchar">unning</span> upstairs to Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s room a quarter
of an hour before his arrival in the morning Miriam
found herself wishing that she lived altogether at Wimpole
Street. They were all so kind. Life would be simplified
if she could throw in her lot with them. Coming in to
breakfast after the lesson had been a sort of home-coming.
There were pleasant noises about the house; the family
shouted carelessly to each other on the stairs, the school-boy
slid down the banisters; the usual subdued manner
of the servants was modified by an air of being a possession
of the house and liking it. They rushed quietly and happily
about. The very aroma of the coffee seemed tranquilly
to feed one. At breakfast everyone was cheerful and kind.
It was home. They were so sympathetic and amused over
the adventure. The meeting in the freshness of the morning
made everything easier to handle. It gave the morning a
beginning and shed its brightness over the professional
hush that fell upon the house at nine o&rsquo;clock. It would
make lunch-time more easy; and at the end of the day,
if asked, she would join the family party again.
</p>

<p>
While Mr. Hancock was looking through his letters she
elaborately suppressed a yawn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How did you get on?&rdquo; he asked, with prompt amusement,
his eyes on a letter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t get off; that was just it&rdquo; murmured
Miriam quietly, enjoying her jest; how strong she felt
after her good breakfast....
</p>

<p>
He turned an amused enquiring face and they both
laughed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-179" class="pagenum" title="179"></a>
Everything in the room was ready for the day&rsquo;s work.
She polished the already bright set of forceps with a
luxurious sense of leisure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was perfectly awful. When we got to the Inner
Circle Mr. Leyton simply put me on the bicycle and sent
me off. <em>He</em> rode round the other way and I had to go on
and on. He scorched about and kept passing me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock waited smiling for the more that stood in
her struggling excited voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There were people going round on horse-back and a
few other people on bicycles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect they all gave you a pretty wide berth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They <em>did</em>; except one awful man, an old gentleman
sailing along looking at nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; laughed Mr. Hancock delightedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was awful, I was most fearfully rude&mdash;I shouted
&lsquo;<em>Get</em> out of the way&rsquo; and I was on the wrong side of the
road; but miles off, only I <em>knew</em> I couldn&rsquo;t get back I had
forgotten how to steer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He swept round me looking very frightened and disturbed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you a bell?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but it meant sliding my hand along. I daren&rsquo;t
do that; nobody seemed to want it, they all glided
about; they were really awfully nice. I <em>had</em> to go on
because I couldn&rsquo;t get off. I can wobble along, but I can&rsquo;t
mount or dismount. I was never so frightened in my
life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve had a very drastic time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I fell off in the end I was so dead beat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But this is altogether too drastic. Where was Leyton?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rushing round and round meeting me and then overtaking
me, startling me out of my wits by ringing behind
for me to get to the side. Nobody else did that. It was
awfully kind. I went tacking about from side to side.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve had a very drastic time. I think
<a id="page-180" class="pagenum" title="180"></a>
you&rsquo;d better come up this evening and learn getting on and
off on the lawn; that&rsquo;s the way to do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; said Miriam gratefully; &ldquo;but I have no machine.
Mrs. Orly lent me hers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay we can hire a machine.&rdquo;

</h3>

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">iriam</span> found it difficult to believe that the girl
was a dental secretary. She swept about among
Miss Szigmondy&rsquo;s guests in a long Liberty dress, her hands
holding her long scarf about her person as if she were
waiting for a clear space to leap or run, staying nowhere,
talking here and there with the assurance of a successful
society woman, laughing and jesting, swiftly talking down
the group she was with and passing on with a shouted
remark about herself as she had done in the library on the
night of Lord Kelvin&rsquo;s lecture.... &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of being
good; I&rsquo;m going to try being naughty for a change.&rdquo; Mr.
Hancock had stood planted before her in laughing admiration,
waiting for the next thing that she might say. How
could he of all men in the world be taken out of himself
by an effective trick? He had laughed more spontaneously
than Miriam had ever seen him do. What <em>was</em> this effective
thing? An appearance of animation. That it seemed,
could make any man, even Mr. Hancock, if it were free
from any suggestion of loudness or vulgarity, stand gaping
and disarmed. Why had he volunteered the information
that she was eighteen and secretary to his friend in Harley
Street. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem very <em>keen</em>&rdquo;; that was her
voice from the other end of the room; using the new smart
word with a delicate emphasis, pretending interest in something,
meaning nothing at all. She was a middle-aged
woman, she would never be older than she was now. She
saw nothing and no one, nor ever would. In all her life
she would never be arrested by anything. Nice kind people
<a id="page-182" class="pagenum" title="182"></a>
would call her &ldquo;a charming girl.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;Charming girls&rdquo;
were taught to behave effectively and lived in a brilliant
death, dealing death all round them. Nothing could live
in their presence. No natural beauty, no spectacle of art,
no thought, no music. They were uneasy in the presence
of these things, because their presence meant cessation of
&ldquo;charming&rdquo; behaviour&mdash;except at such moments as they
could use the occasion to decorate themselves. <em>They had
no souls.</em> Yet in social life nothing seemed to possess any
power but their surface animation.
</p>

<p>
There was real power in that other woman. Her strong
young comeliness was good, known to be good. It was
strange that a student of music should be known for her
work among the poor. The serene large outlines of her
form gave out light in the room; and the light on her
white brow unconscious above her deliberately kind face
was the loveliest thing to be seen; the deliberately kind
face spoiled it, and would presently change it; unless some
great vision came to her it would grow furrowed over &ldquo;the
housing problem&rdquo; and the face would dry up, its white
life cut off at a source; at present she was at the source;
one could tell her anything. Mr. Hancock recognised her
goodness, spoke of her with admiration and respect. What
was she doing here, among all these worldly musicians?
<em>She</em> would never be a musician, never a first-class musician.
Then she had ambition. She was poor. Someone was
helping her ... Miss Szigmondy! Why? She must
know she would never make a musician. Miriam cowered
in her corner. The good woman was actually going to
sing before all these celebrities. What a fine great free
voice.... &ldquo;<em>When</em> shall we meet&mdash;<em>refined</em> and free, amongst
the moorland <em>brack-en</em> ...&rdquo; if Mr. Hancock could have
heard her sing that, surely his heart must have gone out
to her? She knew, to her inmost being, what that meant.
She <em>longed</em> for cleansing fires, even she with her radiant
forehead; her soul flew out along the sustained notes towards
its vision, her dark eyes were set upon it as she sang, the clear
<a id="page-183" class="pagenum" title="183"></a>
tones of her voice called to the companion of her soul for
the best that was in him. She was the soul of truth, counting
no cost. She would attain her vision, though the
earthly companion she longed for might pass her by. The
pure beauty of the moorland would remain for her, would
set itself along the shores of her life forever....
</p>

<p>
But she could not sing. It was the worst kind of English
singing, all volume and emphasis and pressure. Was there
that in her goodness too ... deliberate kindness to everybody.
Was that a method&mdash;just a social method? She was
one of those people about whom it would be said that she
never spoke ill of anyone. But was not indiscriminate
deliberate conscious goodness to everybody an insult to
humanity? People who were like that never knew the
difference between one person and another. &lsquo;Philanthropic&rsquo;
people were never sympathetic. They pitied.
Pity was not sympathy. It was a denial of something. It
assumed that life was pitiful. Yet her clear eyes would see
through anything, any evil thing to the human being
behind. But she knew it, and practised it like a doctor.
She had never been amazed by the fact that there were any
human beings at all ... and with all her goodness she
had plans and ambitions. She wanted to be a singer&mdash;and
she was thinking about somebody. Men were dazzled by
the worldly little secretary and they reverenced the singer
and her kind. Irreligious men would respect religion for
her sake&mdash;and would wish, thinking of her, to live in a
particular kind of way; but she would never lead a man to
religion because she had no thoughts and no ideas.
</p>

<p>
The surprise of finding these two women here and the
pain of observing them was a just reward for having come
to Miss Szigmondy&rsquo;s At Home without a real impulse&mdash;just
to see the musicians and to be in the same room with
them. All that remained was to write to someone about
them by name. There was nothing to do but mention
their names. There was no wonder about them. They were
all <em>fat</em>. Not one of them was an artist and they all hated
<a id="page-184" class="pagenum" title="184"></a>
each other. It was like a ballad concert. They all sang
in the English way. They were not in the least like the
instrumentalists; or St. James&rsquo;s Hall Saturday afternoon
audiences, not that kind of &ldquo;queer soft lot&rdquo;; not shadowy
grey or dead white or with that curious transparent look;
they all looked ruddy or pink, and sleek; they had the
same sort of kindly commonsense as Harriett&rsquo;s Lord and
Lady Bollingdon ... perhaps to keep a voice going it was
necessary to be fat.

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar"><span class="prefirstchar">&ldquo;</span>I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> was simply heavenly going off&mdash;all standing in the
hall in evening dress while the servants blew for
hansoms. I wore my bridesmaid&rsquo;s dress with a piece of
tulle arranged round the top of the bodice. It was wrong
at the back so I had to sit very carefully the whole evening
to prevent it going up like a muffler, but never mind; it
was heavenly I tell you. We bowled off down through
the west-end in three hansoms one behind the other, in
the dark. You know the gleam and shine inside a hansom
sprinting along a dark empty street where the lamps are
few and dim; (see &lsquo;The Organist&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo;) and then
came the bright streets all alight and full of dinner and
theatre people in evening dress in hansoms and you kept
getting wedged in between other hansoms with people
talking and laughing all round you; and it took about
ten minutes to get from the end of Regent Street across
to the other side of Piccadilly where we dined in wicked
Rupert Street. Just as the caviare was brought in we heard
that the Prince of Wales had won the Derby. Shakespeare
is extraordinary. I had no idea Hamlet was so full of
quotations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam flushed heavily as the last words ran automatically
from her pen. The sense of the richly moving picture that
had filled her all the morning and now kept her sitting
happily under the hot roof at her small dusty table in the
full breadth of Saturday afternoon would be gone if she
left that sentence. She felt a curious painful shock at the
tips of her fingers as she re-read it; a current singing
within her was driven back by it.... Mrs. Orly&rsquo;s face
<a id="page-186" class="pagenum" title="186"></a>
had been all alive and alight when she had leant forward
across Mr. Hancock and said the words that had seemed
so meaningless and irritating. Perhaps she too had felt
something she wanted to express and had lost it at that
moment. Certainly both she and Mr. Orly would feel
the beauty of Shakespeare. But the words had shattered
the spell of Shakespeare and writing them down like that
was spoiling the description of the evening, though Harriett
would not think so.
</p>

<p>
But anyhow the letter would not do for Harriett&mdash;even
if words could be found to express &ldquo;Shakespeare.&rdquo; That
would not interest Harriett. She would think the effort
funny and Miriamish but it would not mean anything
to her. She had been to Shakespeare because she adored
Ellen Terry and put up with Irving for her sake....
People in London seemed to think that Irving was just
as great as Ellen Terry.... Perhaps now Irving would
seem different. Perhaps Irving was great.... I will go
and hear Irving in Shakespeare ... no money and no
theatres except with other people.... The rest of the
letter would simply hurt Harriett, because it would seem
like a reflection on theatres with her. Theatres with her
had had a magic that last night could not touch ... sitting
in the front row of the pit, safely in after the long wait,
the walls of the theatre going up, softly lit buff and gold,
fluted and decorated and bulging with red curtained boxes,
the clear view across the empty stalls of the dim height
of fringed curtain hanging in long straight folds, the certainty
that Harriett shared the sense of the theatre, that
for her too when the orchestra began the great motionless
curtain shut them in in a life where everything else
in the world faded away and was forgotten, the sight of
the perfection of happiness on Harriett&rsquo;s little buff-shadowed
face, the sudden running ripple, from side to
side, of the igniting footlights ... the smoothly clicking
rustle of the withdrawing curtain ... the magic square
of the lit scene ... the daily growth of the charm of
<a id="page-187" class="pagenum" title="187"></a>
these things during that week when they had gone to a
theatre every night, so that on looking back the being in
the theatre with the certainty of the moving changing
scenes ahead was clearer than either of the plays they had
seen.... She sat staring through the open lattice....
The sound of the violin from the house down the street
that had been a half-heard <a id="corr-51"></a>obbligato to her vision of last
night came in drearily, filling the space whence the vision
had departed, with uneasy questions. She turned to her
letter to recapture the impulse with which she had sat
down.... If she turned it into a letter to Eve, all the
description of the evening would have to be changed;
Eve knew all about grandeurs, with the Greens&rsquo; large country
house and their shooting-boxes and visits to London hotels;
the bright glories must go&mdash;overwhelming and unexpressed.
Why did that make one so sad? Was it because it suggested
that one cared more for the gay circumstances than
for the thing seen? What was it they had seen? Why
had they gone? What <em>was</em> Shakespeare? Her vision
returned to her as she brooded on this fresh problem.
The whole scene of the theatre was round her once more;
she was sitting in the half darkness gazing at the stage.
What had it been for her? What was it that came from
the stage? Something&mdash;<em>real</em> ... to say that drove it
away. She looked again and it clustered once more, alive.
The gay flood of the streets, the social excitements and
embarrassments of the evening were a conflagration;
circling about the clear bright kernel of moving lights
and figures on the stage. She gazed at the bright stage.
Moments came sharply up, grouped figures, spoken words.
She held them, her contemplation aglow with the certainty
that something was there that set her alight with love,
making her whole in the midst of her uncertainty and
ignorance. Words and phrases came, a sentence here and
there that had suddenly shaped and deepened a scene.
Perhaps it was only in seeing Shakespeare acted that one
could appreciate him? But it was <em>not</em> the acting. No
<a id="page-188" class="pagenum" title="188"></a>
one could act. They all just missed it. It was all very well
for Mag to laugh. They <em>did</em> just miss it.... &ldquo;Why, my
child? In what way?&rdquo; &ldquo;They act at the audience, they
take their cues too quickly and have their emotions too
abruptly; and from outside not inside.&rdquo; &ldquo;But if they
felt <a id="corr-53"></a>at all, all the time, they would go mad or die.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,
they would not. But even if they did not feel it, if they
looked, it would be enough. They don&rsquo;t <em>look</em> at the thing
they are doing.&rdquo; It was not the acting. Nor the play.
The characters of the story were always tiresome. The
ideas, the wonderful quotations if you looked closely at
them were everyone&rsquo;s ideas; things that everybody knew.
To read Shakespeare carefully all through would only be
to find all the general things somewhere or other. But
that did not matter. Being ignorant of him and of history
did not matter, as long as you heard him. Poetry! The
poetry of Shakespeare...? Primers of literature told
one that. It did not explain the charm. Just the sound.
Music. Like Beethoven. Bad acting cannot spoil Shakespeare.
Bad playing cannot destroy Beethoven. It was
the <em>sound</em> of Shakespeare that made the scenes real&mdash;that
made Winter&rsquo;s Tale, so long ago and so bewildering, remain
in beauty.... &ldquo;Dear Eve, Shakespeare is a sound ...&rdquo;
She tore up the letter. The next time she wrote to Eve
she must remember to say that. The garret was stifling.
Away from the brilliant window the room was just as hot;
the close thick smell of dust sickened her. She came back
to the table, sitting as near as possible to the open. The
afternoon had been wasted trying to express her evening
and nothing had been expressed. The thought of last
night was painful now. She had spoiled it in some way.
Her heart beat heavily in the stifling room. Her head
ached and her eyes were tired. She was too tired to walk;
and there was no money; barely enough for next week&rsquo;s
A.B.C. suppers. There was no comfort. It was May ...
in a stuffy dusty room. May. Her face quivered and her
head sank upon the hot table.

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">N</span><span class="postfirstchar">early</span> all the roses were half-opened buds; firm
and stiff. Larger ones put in here and there gave
the effect of mass. Closest contemplation enhanced the
beauty of the whole. Each rose was perfect. The radiant
mass was lovely throughout. The body of the basket
curved firmly away to its slender hidden base; the smooth
sweep of the rim and the delicate high arch of the handle
held the roses perfectly framed. It was a perfect gift....
It had been quite enough to have the opportunity of doing
little things for Mrs. Berwick ... the surprise of the
roses. The <em>surprise</em> of them. Roses, roses, roses ... all
the morning they had stood, making the morning&rsquo;s work
happy; visible all over the room. Everyone in the house
had had the beautiful shock of them. And they were still
as they had been when they had been gathered in the dew.
If they were in water by the end of the afternoon the buds
would revive and expand ... even after the hours in the
Lyceum. If they were thrown now into the waste-paper
basket it would not matter. They would go on being
perfect&mdash;to the end of life. &ldquo;And as long; as my heart
is bea-ting; as long; as my eyes; have; tears.&rdquo;

<p class="noindent">
Winthrop came up punctually at one o&rsquo;clock as he had
promised. &ldquo;It would save you comin&rsquo; down if I was to
ph-come up.&rdquo; It would go on then. He had thought
about it and meant to do it. She opened the cash box
quickly and deftly in her gratitude and handed him his
four sovereigns and the money for the second mechanic
<a id="page-190" class="pagenum" title="190"></a>
and the apprentices. He waited gently while she counted
it out. Next Saturday she would have it ready for him.
&ldquo;Thank you Miss&mdash;&mdash;; ph&mdash;ph <em>Good</em> afternoon&rdquo; he
said cheerfully. &ldquo;Good afternoon Mr. Winthrop&rdquo; she
responded busily with all her heart and listened as he
clattered away downstairs. A load was lifted from Saturday
mornings, for good. No more going down to run the
gauntlet of the row of eyes and get herself along the bench,
depositing the various sums. Nothing in future but the
letters, the overhauling of Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s empty surgery,
the easy lunch with Mr. Leyton, and the week-end. She
entered the sums in the petty cash book. There was that.
They would always be that week after week. But to-day
the worrying challenge of <a id="corr-54"></a>it disappeared in the joy of the
last entry. &ldquo;Self&rdquo; she wrote, the light across the outspread
prospect of her life steadying and deepening as she
wrote, &ldquo;one pound, five.&rdquo; The five, written down, sent
a thrill from the contemplated page. Taking the customary
sovereign from the cash-box she placed it carefully in the
middle pocket of her purse and closed the clip. The five
shillings she distributed about the side-pockets; half a
crown, a shilling, two sixpenny bits and six coppers. The
purse was full of money. By September she would have
about four pounds five in hand and two pounds ten of her
month&rsquo;s holiday money still unspent; six pounds fifteen;
she could go to a matinée every week and still have about
half the four pounds five; about four pounds fifteen altogether;
enough to hire a bicycle for the month and buy
some summer blouses for the holiday.... She pocketed
the heavy purse. Why was there always a feeling of guilt
about a salary? It was the same every week. The life at
Wimpole Street was so full and so interesting; she was
learning so much and seeing so much. Salary was out of
place&mdash;a payment for leading a glorious life, half of which
was entirely her own. The extra five shillings was a present
from the Orlys and Mr. Hancock. She could manage
on the pound. The new sum was wealth, superfluity.
<a id="page-191" class="pagenum" title="191"></a>
They would expect more of her in future. Surely it would
be possible to give more; with so much money; to find
the spirit to come punctually at nine; always to have
everything in complete readiness in all three surgeries;
to keep all the books up to date.... But they would not
have given her the rise at the end of five months if they
had not felt she was worth it.... It would make all the
difference to the summer. Hopefully she took a loose sheet
of paper and made two lists of the four pages of the week&rsquo;s
entries&mdash;dissecting them under the heads of workshop and
surgery. About fifteen pounds had been spent. Again
and again with heating head she added her pages of small
sums, getting each time slightly different results, until at
last they balanced with the dissected lists&mdash;twice in succession.
The hall clock struck one and Mr. Leyton came
downstairs rattling and rattled into her room. &ldquo;How
d&rsquo;you like this get up?&rdquo; The general effect of the blue
grey uniform and brown leather belt and bandolier was
pleasing. &ldquo;Oh, <em>jolly</em>&rdquo; she said abstractedly to his waiting
figure. He clattered downstairs to lunch. <em>Everybody</em> had
outside interests. Mr. Hancock would be on the Broads
by now. Her afternoon beckoned, easy with the superfluity
of money. Anxiously she counted over the balance
in the cash box. It was two and ninepence short. Damnation.
Damnation. &ldquo;Put it down to stamps&mdash;or miscellanea;
not accounted for.&rdquo; She looked back through
her entries. Stamps, one pound, at the beginning of the
week. Stamps, ten shillings yesterday. It could not be
that. It was some carelessness&mdash;something not entered&mdash;or
a miscalculation. Something she had paid out to the
workshop in the middle of a rush and forgotten to put
down. She went back through her entries one by one with
flaring cheeks; recovering the history of the week and recalling
incidents. Nothing came that would account for
the discrepancy. It was simply a mistake. Something had
been put down wrong. The money had been spent. But
was it a workshop or a surgery expense that had gone wrong?
<a id="page-192" class="pagenum" title="192"></a>
&ldquo;Postage etc.: two and nine,&rdquo; would make it all right&mdash;but
the account would not be right. Either the workshop
or the surgery account must suffer. It would be another
of those little inaccurate spots that came every few weeks;
that she would always have to remember ... her mind
toiled, goaded and hot.... Mr. Orly had borrowed five
pounds to buy tools at Buck and Hickman&rsquo;s and come
back with the money spent and some of the tools to be
handed to the practice. Perhaps it was in balancing that
up that the mistake had occurred ... or the electric lamp
account; some for the house, some for the practice and
some for the workshop. Thoroughly miserable she made a
provisional entry of the sum against surgery in pencil and
left the account unbalanced. Perhaps on Monday it would
come right. When the ledgers were all in place and the
safe and drawers locked she stretched her limbs and forced
away her misery. The roses reproached her, but only for
a moment. They understood, in detail, as clearly as she
did, all the difficulties. They took her part. Standing
there waiting, they too felt that there was nothing now but
lunch and Irving.

<p class="noindent">
With the basket of roses over her arm she walked as
rapidly as possible down to Oxford Circus taking the first
turning out of Wimpole Street to hurry the more secretly
and conveniently. A &rsquo;bus took her to Charing Cross where
she jumped off as soon as it began pulling up and ran
down the Strand. As soon as she felt herself flying towards
her bourne the fears that last week&rsquo;s magic would have
disappeared left her altogether. Last week had been
wonderful, an adventure her first deliberate piece of daring
in London. Inside the theatre the scruples and the daring
had been forgotten. To-day again everything would be
forgotten, everything; to-day&rsquo;s happiness was more secure;
it would not mean going almost foodless over the week-end
and without an egg for supper all next week; there
<a id="page-193" class="pagenum" title="193"></a>
was no anticipation of disapproving eyes in the theatre
this week; the sense of the impropriety of going alone
had gone; it would never return; the feeling of selfishness
in spending money on a theatre alone was still there, but a
voice within answered that&mdash;saying that there was no one
at hand to go and no one she knew who would find at the
Lyceum performance just what she found, no one to whom
it would mean much more than a theatre; like any other
theatre and a play, amongst other plays, with a celebrated
actor taking the chief part ... except Mag. Mag had
been with her as she gazed. Mag was with her now. Mag,
fulfilling one or other of her exciting Saturday afternoon
engagements would sit at her side.
</p>

<p>
Easy and happy she fled along ... her heart greeting
each passenger in the scattered throng she threaded,
her eyes upon the traffic in the roadway. A horseless
brougham went by, moving smoothly and silently amongst
the noisy traffic&mdash;the driver looked as though he were
fastened to the front of the vehicle, a little tin driver on a
clockwork toy; there was nothing between him and the
road but the platform of the little tank on which his feet
were set. He looked as if he were falling off. If anything
ran into him there was nothing to protect him. It left
an uncomfortable memory ... it would only be for
carriages; the well-loved horse omnibuses would go on
... it must be somewhere near here ... &ldquo;Lyceum Pit,&rdquo;
there it was, just ahead, easily discernible. Last week when
she had had to ask, she had not noticed the words printed
on the side of the passage that showed as you came down
the Strand. The pavement was clear for a moment and
she rounded the near angle and ran home down the passage
without slackening her pace, her half-crown ready in her
hand, a Lyceum pittite.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-15-3">

<p class="noindent">
The dark pit seemed very full as she entered the door
at the left hand corner; dim forms standing at the back
<a id="page-194" class="pagenum" title="194"></a>
told her there were no seats left; but she made her way
across to the right and down the incline hoping for a
neglected place somewhere on the extreme right. Her
vain search brought her down to the barrier and the end
of her inspection of the serried ranks of seated forms to
her left swept her eyes forward. She was just under the
overhanging balcony of the dress-circle; the well of the
theatre opened clear before her as she stood against the
barrier, the stalls half full and filling with dim forms gliding
in right and left, the upward sweep of the theatre walls
covered with boxes from which white faces shone in the
gloom, a soft pervading saffron light, bright light heavily
screened. There was space all round her, the empty gangway
behind, the gangway behind the stalls just in front
of the barrier, the view clear away to the stage over the
heads of the people sitting in the stalls.... Why not
stay here? If people stood at the back of the pit they might
stand in front. She retreated into the angle made by the
out-curving wall of the pit and the pit barrier. Putting
down the basket of roses on the floor at her side she leaned
against the barrier with her elbows on its rim.

He was there before he appeared ... in the orchestra,
in the audience, all over the house. Presently, in a few
moments he was going to appear, moving and speaking on
the stage. Someone might come forward and announce
that he was ill or dead. He would die; perhaps only
years hence; but long before one was old ... death of
Henry Irving. No more thoughts of that; he is there&mdash;perhaps
for twenty years; coming and going, having
seasons at the Lyceum. He knew he must die; he did
not think about it. He could turn with a smile and go
straight up, in a rosy chariot ... well done thou good
and faithful and happy servant. He would go, closing
his eyes upon the vision that was always in them, something
they saw, something they gave out every moment.
<a id="page-195" class="pagenum" title="195"></a>
Whom the gods love die young ... not always young
in years, but young always; trailing clouds of glory. It
is always the unexpected that happens. Things you dread
never happen. That is Weber&mdash;or Meyerbeer. Who
chooses the music? Perhaps he does.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;

<p class="noindent">
The orchestration brought back last week&rsquo;s performance.
It was all there; behind the curtain. Shylock, swinging
across the stage with his halting dragging stride; halting,
standing with bent head; shut-in, lonely sweetness. She
looked boldly now, untrammelled in her dark corner at the
pictures which had formed part of her distant view all last
week in the far-away life at Wimpole Street; the great
scenes ... beautifully staged; &ldquo;Irving always <em>stages</em> everything
perfectly&rdquo;&mdash;and battled no longer against her sympathy
for Shylock. It no longer shocked her to find herself sharing
something of his longing for the blood of the Christians.
It was wrong; but were not they too wrong? They must be;
there must be some reason for this certainty of sympathy
with Shylock and aversion from Bassanio. It might be a
wrong reason, but it was there in her. Mag said &ldquo;that&rsquo;s his
genius; he makes you sympathise even with Shylock....&rdquo;
He shows you that you <em>do</em> sympathise with Shylock; Mag
thinks that is something to admit shamefacedly. Because
those other people were to her just &ldquo;people.&rdquo; Bassanio&mdash;was
it not just as wrong to get into debt and raise money
from the Jews as to let money out on usury? But it was
his friend. He was innocent. Never mind. They were
all, all, smug and complacent in their sunshine. Polished
lustful man, with his coarse lustful men friends. Portia
and Nerissa were companions in affliction. Beautiful first
of all; as lovely and wandering and full of visions as Shylock
until their lovers came. Hearn was right. English lovers
would shock any Japanese. Not that the Japanese were
prudish. According to him they were anything but ...
they would not talk as Englishmen did among themselves
and in mixed society in a sort of code; thinking themselves
<a id="page-196" class="pagenum" title="196"></a>
so clever; anyone could talk a code who chose to descend
to a mechanical trick.
</p>

<p>
How much more real was the relation between Portia
and Nerissa than between either of the sadly jesting women
and their complacently jesting lovers. Did a man <em>ever</em>
speak in a natural voice&mdash;neither blustering, nor displaying
his cleverness, nor being simply a lustful slave? Women
always despise men under the influence of passion or fatigue.
What horrible old men those two would be&mdash;still speaking
in put on voices to hide their shame, pompous and philosophising....
&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s love is of man&rsquo;s life a thing apart ...&rdquo;
so much the worse for man; there must be something
very wrong with his life. But it would go on until
men saw and admitted this.... Portia was right when
she preached her sermon&mdash;it made everyone feel sorry
for all harshness&mdash;then one ought not to be harsh to the
blindness of men ... somebody had said men would lose
all their charm if they lost their vanity and childish cocksureness
about their superiority&mdash;to force and brow-beat
them into seeing themselves would not help&mdash;but that is
what I want to do. I am like a man in that, overbearing,
bullying, blustering. I am something between a man and
a woman; looking both ways. But to pretend one did
not see through a man&rsquo;s voice would be treachery. Nearly
all men will hate me&mdash;because I can&rsquo;t play up for long.
Harshness must go; perhaps that was what Christ meant.
But Portia only wanted to save Bassanio&rsquo;s life; and did it
by a trick. It was not a Daniel come to judgment; it
showed the folly of law; pettifogging; the abuse of the
letter of the law. She was harsh to Shylock. Which is
most cruel, to take life or to torture the living? The
Christians were so self-satisfied; going off to their love-making;
that spoiled the play, their future was much more
dark and miserable than the struggle between the sensual
Englishman and the wily Jew. The play ought to have
ended there, with the woman in the cap and gown pleading,
showing something that could not be denied&mdash;ye are all
<a id="page-197" class="pagenum" title="197"></a>
together in one condemnation. In that moment Portia
was great, her red robe shone and lit the world. She ought
to have left them all and gone through all the law courts
of the world; showing up the law. Wit. Woman&rsquo;s wit.
Men at least bowed down to that; though they did not
know what it was. &lsquo;Wit&rsquo; used to mean knowledge&mdash;&ldquo;in-wit,&rdquo;
conscience. The knowledge of woman is larger,
bigger, deeper, less wordy and clever than that of men.
Certainly. But why do not men acknowledge this? They
talk about mother-love and mother-wit and instinct, as if
they were mysterious tricks. They have no real knowledge,
but of things; a sort of superiority they get by being free
to be out in the world amongst things; they do not understand
people. If a woman is good it is all right; if she
is bad it is all wrong. Cherchez la femme. Then everything
in life depends upon women? &ldquo;A civilisation can
never rise above the level of its women.&rdquo; Perhaps if women
became lawyers they would change things. Women do not
respect law. No wonder, since it is folly, an endless play
on words. Portia? She had been quite complacent about
being unkind to the Jew. She had been invented by a man.
There was no reality in any of Shakespeare&rsquo;s women. They
please men because they show women as men see them.
All the other things are invisible; nothing but their thoughts
and feelings about men and bothers. Shakespeare did not
know the meaning of the words and actions of Nerissa and
Portia when they were alone together, the beauty they
knew and felt and saw, holy beauty everywhere. Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays are &lsquo;universal&rsquo; because they are about the
things that everybody knows and hands about, and they
do not trouble anybody. They make everyone feel wise.
It isn&rsquo;t what he says it&rsquo;s the way he says all these things
that don&rsquo;t matter and leave everything out. It&rsquo;s all a sublime
fuss.
</p>

<p>
Italians! Of course. Well&mdash;Europeans. It is the
difference between the Europeans and the Japanese that
Hearn had meant.

Then there <em>is</em> tragedy! Things are not simple right
and wrong. There are a million sides to every question;
as many sides as there are people to see and feel them
and in all big national struggles two clear sides, both right
and both wrong. The man who wrote &ldquo;The Struggle
against Absolute Monarchy&rdquo; was a Roundhead; and he
made me a Roundhead; Green&rsquo;s History is Roundhead.
I never saw Charles&rsquo; point of view or thought about it;
but only of the unjust levies and the dissolution of Parliament
and the dissoluteness of the Court. If I had seen
Irving then it would have made a difference. He could
never have been Cromwell. He is Charles. Things happen.
People tell him things and he cannot understand. He
believes in divine right ... sweet and gentle, with perfect
manners for all ... perfect in private life ... the first
gentleman in the land, the only person free to have perfect
manners; the representative of God on earth. &ldquo;Decaying
feudalism.&rdquo; But they ought not to have killed him. He
cannot <em>understand</em>. He is the scapegoat. Freedom looks
so fine in your mind. Parliaments and Trial by Jury and
the abolition of the Star Chamber and the triumph of
Cromwell&rsquo;s visionaries. But it means this gentle velvet-coated
figure with its delicate ruffled hands, its sweetness
and courtesy, going with bandaged eyes&mdash;to death. Was
there no way out? Must one either be a Royalist or a
Roundhead. Must monarchies decay? Then why did
the Restoration come? What do English people want?
&ldquo;A limited Monarchy&rdquo;; a King controlled by Parliament.
As well not have a King at all. Who would not
rather live with Charles than with Cromwell? Charles
would have entertained a beggar royally. Cromwell was
too busy with &ldquo;affairs of State&rdquo; to entertain beggars.
Charles dying for his faith was more beautiful than Cromwell
fighting for his reason. Yet the people must be free;
there must be justice. Kings ought to be taught differently.
<a id="page-199" class="pagenum" title="199"></a>
He did not understand. No one believing in divine right
can understand. Was the idea of divine right a mistake?
Can no one be trusted? Cromwell&rsquo;s son was a weak fool.
How can a country be ruled? People will never agree.
What ought one to be if one can neither be quite a Roundhead
nor quite a Cavalier? They worshipped two gods.
Are there two Gods?... Irving ... walking gently about
inside Charles feeling as he felt the beauty of the sunlit
garden, the delicate clothes, the refinement of fine living,
the charm of perfect association, the rich beauty of each
day as it passed.... Charles died with all that in his eyes,
<em>knowing</em> it <em>good</em>. Cromwell was a farmer. Christ was a
carpenter. Christ did not bother about kings. &ldquo;Render
unto Cæsar.&rdquo;

the bright evening daylight of the Finchley Road.
Miriam held her knowledge suspended, looking forward
to the enclosure at the end of the few minutes&rsquo; walk. But
the conservatoire was not enclosed. The clear bright light
flooding the rows and rows of seated summer clad Hampstead
people and lighting up every corner of the level square
hall was like the outside evening daylight. The air seemed
as pure as the outside air. She followed Mr. Hancock to
their seats at the gangway end of the fourth row passing
between the sounds echoing thinly from the platform and
the wave of attention sweeping towards the platform from
the massed rows of intelligent faces. As they sat down the
chairman&rsquo;s voice ceased and the lights were lowered; but
so slightly that the hall was still perfectly exposed and clear.
The people still looked as though they were out of doors
or in their large houses. This was modern improvement&mdash;hard
clear light. Their minds and their thoughts and their
lives and their clothes were always in it. She stared at the
screen. A large slide was showing, lit from behind. It
made a sort of stage scenery for the rest of the scene, all
in one light. She fixed her attention. An enormous
vessel with its side stove in, yes, &ldquo;stove in&rdquo;; in a dock.
They got <em>information</em> at any rate and then perhaps got
free and thought their own thoughts. No. They would
follow and think and talk intelligently about the information.
Rattling their cultured voices. Mad with pretences....
In <em>dry</em> dock, going to be repaired. Gazing sternly
<a id="page-201" class="pagenum" title="201"></a>
at the short man with the long pointer talking in an anxious
high thin voice, his head with its upstanding crest of hair
half-turned towards the audience, she suppressed a giggle.
Folding her hands she gazed, shaking in every limb, not
daring to follow what he said for fear of laughing aloud.
Shreds of his first long sentence caught in her thoughts
and gave her his meaning, shaking her into giggles. Her
features quivered under her skin as she held them in forcing
her eyes towards the distances of sky beyond the ship.
Her customary expletives shot through her mind in rapid
succession with each one the scarves and silk and velvet
of the audience grew brighter about the edge of her circle
of vision.

She was an upstart and an alien and here she was.
It was more extraordinary in this Hampstead clarity than
at a theatre or concert in town. It was a part of his
world ... and theirs; one might get the manner and still
keep alive.... Was he out of humour because he had
realised what he had done or because she had been late for
dinner? Was he thinking what his behaviour amounted
to in the eyes of his aunt and cousins; even supposing
they did not know that the invitation to dinner and the
lecture had been given only this afternoon? He must have
known it was necessary to go home and tidy up. When
he said the conservatoire was so near that there would be
plenty of time was not that as good as saying she might be

So he knew they were coming ... and then to go marching

I could not imagine at first what was wrong. He was looking
so strange. The women barely noticed me&mdash;barely
noticed me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid dinner will be spoiled&rdquo; he said,
<a id="page-202" class="pagenum" title="202"></a>
in his way. &ldquo;They had all been sitting round the fire three
mortal quarters of an hour waiting for <em>me</em>!&rdquo; How they
would talk. Their thoughts and feelings about employees
could be seen at a glance. It was bad enough for them to
have a secretary appearing at dinner the first evening of
their great visit. And now they were sitting alone round
the fire and she was at the lecture alone, unchaperoned,
with him, &ldquo;she had the effrontery to come to dinner
three quarters of an hour late ...&rdquo; feathery hair and
periwinkle eyes and white noses; gentle die-away voices.
Perhaps the thought of his favourite cousins coming next
week buoyed him up. No wonder he wanted to get away to
the lecture. He had come, reasonably; not seeing why he
should not; just as he would have gone if they had not
been there. Now he saw it as they saw it. There he sat.
She gazed at the shifting scenes ... ports and strange
islands in distant seas, sunlit coloured mountains tops
peaking up from forests. The lecturing voice was far away,
irrelevant and unintelligible. Peace flooded her.

<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> patient sat up with a groan of relief. His dark
strong positive liverish profile turned away towards the
spittoon. There was a clean broad gap of neck between the
strong inturned ending of his hair and the narrow strip of
firm heavily glazed blue white collar fitting perfectly into
the collar of the well-cut grey coat clothing the firm <a id="corr-58"></a>bulk
of his body. &ldquo;To my mind there&rsquo;s no reason why they
shouldn&rsquo;t do thoroughly well&rdquo; he said into the spittoon.
&ldquo;All the hospitals would employ &rsquo;em in the end. They&rsquo;re
more natty and conscientious than men and there&rsquo;s nothing
in the work they can&rsquo;t manage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I think that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam cleared her throat emphatically. They had no
right to talk in that calm disposing way in the presence of a
woman. Mr. Hancock felt that too. That kind of man was
always nice to women. Strong and cheerful and helping
them; but with his mind full of quotations and generalisations.
He would bring them out anywhere. It would
never occur to him that the statement of them could
be offensive. His newspaper office would be full of little
girls. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s those little ph&rsquo;girls.&rdquo; But the Amalgam
Company probably had quite uneducated girls. Nobody
ought to be asked to spend their lives calculating decimal
quantities. The men who lived on these things had their
drudgery done for them. They did it themselves first.
Yes, but then it meant their future. A woman clerk never
becomes a partner. There was no hope for women in
business. That man&rsquo;s wife would be wealthy and screened
<a id="page-204" class="pagenum" title="204"></a>
and looked after all her days; he working. He would
live as long as she&mdash;a little old slender nut-brown man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was the employment Mr. Dolland was speaking
of?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dispensing. I think he&rsquo;s quite right. And it&rsquo;s not
at all badly paid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It ought not to be. Think of the responsibility and
anxiety.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a jolly stiff exam too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like the calm way he talks, as if it were his business
to decide what is suitable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hancock laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very influential man,
you know,&rdquo; he said going to the tube. &ldquo;Yes?&mdash;Oh,
show them up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam detected the note that meant a trial ahead and
went about her clearing with quiet swift busy sympathy.
But Mr. Dolland had been a good introduction to the
trying hour. Her thoughts followed his unconsciousness
down to his cab. She saw the spatted boot on the footplate,
the neat strong swing of the body, the dip of the
hansom, the darkling face sitting inside under the shiny
hat ... the room had become dreadful; empty and
silent; pressed full with a dreadful atmosphere; those
women from Rochester&mdash;but they always sat still. These
people were making little faint fussings of movement,
like the creakings of clothes in church and the same silent
hostile feeling; people being obliged to be with people.
There were two or three besides the figure in the chair.
Mr. Hancock had got to work with silent assiduity. His
face when he turned to the cabinet was disordered, separate
from the room and from his work; a most curious expression.
He turned again, busily. It was something in the
mouth, resentful, and a bad-tempered look in the eyes;
a look of discomposed youth. Of course. The aunt and
cousins. Had she cut them, standing with her back to the
room, or they her? She moved sideways with her bundle
of cleaned instruments to the cabinet putting them all
<a id="page-205" class="pagenum" title="205"></a>
on the flap and beginning to open drawers, standing at his
elbow as he stood turned away from the chair mixing a
paste.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might leave those there for the present&rdquo; he
murmured. She turned and went down the room between
the unoccupied seated figures, keeping herself alert to
respond to a greeting. They sat vacant and still. Ladies
in church. Acrimonious. Querulously dressed in pretty
materials and colours that would only keep fresh in the
country. She went to the door lingeringly. It was so
familiar. There had been all that at Babington. It was
that that was in these figures straggling home from school,
in pretty successful clothes, walking along the middle of
the sunlit road ... <em>May-bell</em> deah ... not balancing along
the row of drain pipes nor pulling streaks of Berkshire goody
through their lips. This was their next stage. When she
reached the stairs she felt herself wrapped in their scorn.
It was true; there was something impregnable about them.
They sat inside a little fortress, letting in only certain
people. But they did not know she could see everything
inside the fortress, hear all their thoughts much more clearly
than the things they said. To them she was a closed book.
They did not want to open it. But if they had wanted
to they could not have read.

The <em>insolence</em> of it. Her social position had been identical
with theirs and his. Her early circumstances a good deal
more ambitious and generous.... &lsquo;A moment of my
consciousness is wider than any of theirs will be in the whole
of their lives.&rsquo; ... If she could have stayed in all that, she
would have been as far as possible just the same, sometimes
... for certain purposes. A little close group, loyal
and quarrelsome for ends that any woman could see through.
Fawning and flattering and affectionate to each other and
getting half-maddened by the one necessity. The girls
would repeat the history of their mother, and get her
<a id="page-206" class="pagenum" title="206"></a>
sour faced pretty delicate refinement. They were so
exquisite, now, to look at&mdash;the flower-like edges of their
faces, unchanging from morning to night; warmth and
care and cleanliness and rich clean food; no fatigue or
worry or embarrassment, once they had learned how to
sit and move and eat. To many men they would appear
angels. They would not meet many in the Berkshire
valley. But their mother would man&oelig;uvre engagements
for them and their men would see them as angels fresh
from their mother&rsquo;s hands; miracles of beauty and
purity....
</p>

<p>
Refined shrews, turning in circles, like moths on pins;
brainless, mindless, heartless, the prey of the professions;
priests, doctors and lawyers. These two groups kept each
other going. There was something hidden in the fact
that these women&rsquo;s men always entered professions.

Large portions of the mornings and afternoons of that
week were free from visits to the upstairs surgery. From
Tuesday morning she kept it well filled with supplies;
guessing that she was to be saved further contact with the
aunt and cousins; and drew from the stimulus of their
comings and goings, the sound of their voices in the hall
and on the stairs a fund of energy that filled her unexpected
stretches of leisure with unceasing methodical
labour. Uninterrupted work on the ledgers awakened her
interest in them, the sense that the books were nearly all
up to date, the possibility of catching up altogether before
the end of the week brought a relief and a sense of mastery
that made the June sunshine gay morning after morning
as she tramped through it along the Euston Road. Every
hour was full of a strange excitement. Wide vistas shone
ahead. On the first of September shone a blinding radiance.
She would get up that morning in her dusty garret in the
heat and dust of London with nothing to do for a month;
<a id="page-207" class="pagenum" title="207"></a>
and ride away, somewhere, ride away through the streets,
free, out to the suburbs, like a Sunday morning ride, and
then into the country. She had weathered the winter and
the strange beginnings and would go away to come back;
the rest of the summer till then would go dancing, like a
dream. There was all that coming; making her heart
leap when she thought of it, unknown Wiltshire&mdash;with
Leader landscapes for a week and then something else. And
meanwhile Wimpole Street. She went about her work
borne along unwearied upon a tide that flowed out in
glistening sunlit waves over the sunlit shore of the world.
The doors and windows of her cool shaded room opened
upon a life that spread out before her fanwise towards
endless brilliant distances. Moments of fatigue, little
obstinate knots and tangles of urgent practical affairs did
their utmost to convince her that life was a perpetual
conflict, nothing certain and secure but the thwarting
and discrediting of the dream-vision; every contact seemed
to end in an assurance of her unarmed resourceless state.
Pausing now and again to balance her account, to try to
find a sanction for her joy, she watched and felt the little
stabs of the actual facts as they would be summarised by
some disinterested observer, and again and again saw them
foiled. Things danced, comically powerless against some
unheard piping; motes, funny and beloved, in the sunbeam
of her life.... Next week and the coming of the favourite
cousins made a bright barrier across the future and a little
fence round her labours. Everything must be ordered and
straight before then. She must be free and reproachless
for the wonders and terrors of their visit.... Perhaps
there might be only the one meeting; the evening already
arranged might be all the week&rsquo;s visit would bring. The
week would pass unseen by her and everything would be
as before. As before; was not that enough, and more
than enough?

Her rare visits to the surgery were festivals. Free from
the usual daily fatigue of constant standing for reiterated
clearances and cleansings of small sets of instruments, she
swept full of cheerful strength, her mind free for method,
her hands steady and deft, upon the accumulations left by
long sittings, rapping out her commentary upon his prolonged
endurance by emphatic bumpings of basins and
utensils; making it unnecessary for him to voice the controlled
exasperation that spoke for her from every movement
and tone. Once or twice she felt it wavering towards
speech and whisked about and bumped things down with
extra violence. Once or twice he smiled into her angry
face and she feared he was going to speak of them.

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> was a sort of formality. They all three seemed to
be waiting for something to begin. They were not
at ease. Perhaps they had come to the end of everything
they had to say to each other and had only the memory
of their common youth to bind them to each other.
Members of the same family never seemed to be quite
at ease sitting together doing nothing. These three met
so seldom that they were obliged when they met to appear
to be giving their whole attention to each other, sitting
confronted and trying to keep talk going all the time.
That made everyone speak and smile and look self-consciously.
Perhaps they reminded each other by their mutual
presence that the dreams of their youth had not been
fulfilled. And the cousins were formal. Like the other
cousins they belonged to the prosperous provincial middle
class that always tries to get its sons into professions. Without
the volume of Sophocles one would have known he was
part of a school and she would have been nothing but the
wife or daughter or sister of an English professional man.
It was always the same world; once the only world that
was worthy of one&rsquo;s envious admiration and respect;
changed now ... &ldquo;hardworked little text book people
and here and there an enlightened thwarted man.&rdquo; ...
Was Mr. Canfield thwarted? There was a curious look
of lonely enlightenment about his head. At the University,
and now and again with a head master or a fellow assistant-master
he had had moments of exchange and been happy
for a moment and seen the world alight. But his happiest
<a id="page-210" class="pagenum" title="210"></a>
times had been in loneliness, with thoughts coming to him
out of books. They had been his solace and his refuge
since he was fifteen; and in spite of the hair greying his
temples he was still fifteen; within him were all the
dreams and all the dreadful crudities of boyhood ...
he had never grown to man&rsquo;s estate.... He had understood
at once. &ldquo;It always seems unnecessary to explain
things to people; you feel while you are explaining that
they will meet the same thing themselves, perhaps in some
different form; but certainly, because things are all the
same.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes; that&rsquo;s certainly so.&rdquo; He had looked
pleased and lightened. Darkness and cold had come in an
instant with Mrs. Canfield&rsquo;s unexpected reverent voice.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand what that means; tell me.&rdquo;
She had put down her fancy work and lifted her flower-like
face, not suspiciously as the other cousins would have
done, but with their type of gentle formal refinement
and something of their look. She could be sour and acid
if she chose. She could curl her lips and snub people.
What was the secret of the everlasting same awfulness of
even the nicest of refined sheltered middle-class Englishwoman?
He had stumbled and wandered through a vague
statement. He knew that all the long loneliness of his
mind lay revealed before one&mdash;and yet she had been the
dream and wonder and magic of his youth and still was his
dear companion. The &lsquo;lady&rsquo; was the wife for the professional
Englishman&mdash;simple sheltered domesticated, trained
in principles she did not think about and living by them;
revering professional and professionally successful men;
never seeing the fifth-form schoolboys they all were. No
woman who saw them as they were with their mental
pride and vanity and fixity, would stay with them; no
woman who saw their veiled appetites.... But where
could all these wives go?

<p class="noindent">
Throughout the evening she was kept quiet and dull
and felt presently very weary. Her helpless stock-taking
<a id="page-211" class="pagenum" title="211"></a>
made it difficult to face the strangers, lest painful illumination
and pity and annoyance should stream from her too
visibly.... Perhaps they too took stock and pitied; but
they were interested, a little eager in response and though
too well bred for questions, obviously full of unanswered
surmises, which perhaps presently they would communicate
to each other. There were people who would say she was
too egoistic to be interested in them, a selfish, unsocial,
unpleasant person and they were kind charming people,
interested in everybody. That might be true.... But
it was also true that they were eager and interested because
their lives were empty of everything but principles and a
certain fixed way of looking at things; and one could be
fond of their niceness and respectful to their goodness
but never interested because one knew everything about
them, even their hidden thoughts and the side of them
that was not nice or good without having any communication
with them.... He had another side; but there was
no place in his life which would allow it expression. It
could only live in the lives of people met in books; in
sympathies here and there for a moment; in people who
passed &ldquo;like ships in the night&rdquo;; in moments at the
beginning and end of holidays when things would seem
real, and as if henceforth they were going to be real every
day. If it found expression in his life, it would break up
that life. Anyone who tried to make it find personal expression
would be cruel; unless it were to turn him into a
reformer or the follower of a reformer. That could happen
to him. He was secretly interested in adventurers and
adventuresses.

<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> had evidently been a great festival. One of the
events of Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s summer; designed by him
for the happiness and enjoyment of his friends and enjoyed
by him in labouring to those ends. It was <em>beautiful</em> to look
back upon; in every part; the easy journey, the approach
to the cottage along the mile of green-feathered river, the
well-ordered feast in the large clean cottage; the well-thought out
comfort of the cottage bedrooms, the sight of
the orchard lit by Chinese lanterns, the lantern-lit boats,
the drifting down the river in the soft moonlit air; the
candle lit supper table, morning through the cottage
windows, upstairs and down, far away from the world,
people meeting at breakfast like travellers in a far-off
country, pleased to see well known faces ... the morning
on the green river ... the gentleness and kindliness and
quiet dignity of everybody, the kindly difficult gently
jesting discussion of small personal incidents; the gentle
amiable strains; the mild restrained self-effacing watchfulness
of the women; the uncompeting mutual admiration
of the men; the general gratitude of the group when one
or other of the men filled up a space of time with a piece
of modestly narrated personal reminiscence....

Never, never could she belong to that world. It was a
perfect little world; enclosed; something one would need
to be born and trained into; the experience of it as an outsider
<a id="page-213" class="pagenum" title="213"></a>
was pure pain and misery; admiration, irritation and
resentment running abreast in a fever. Welcome and kindliness
could do nothing; one&rsquo;s own straining towards it,
nothing; a night of sleepless battering at its closed doors,
nothing. There was a secret in it, in spite of its simple
seeming exterior; an undesired secret. Something to which
one could not give oneself up. Its terms were terms on
which one could not live. That girl could live on them, in
spite of her strenuous different life in the east-end settlement
... in spite of her plain dull dress and red hands.
She knew the code; her cheap straw hat waved graciously,
her hair ruffled about her head in soft clouds. Why had he
never spoken of her uncle&rsquo;s cottage so near his own? She
must be always there. When she appeared in the surgery
she seemed to come straight out of the east-end ... his
respect for workers amongst the poor ... his general
mild revulsion from philanthropists; but down here she
was not a philanthropist ... outwardly a girl with blowy
hair and a wavy hat, smiling in boats, understanding botany
and fishing ... inwardly a designing female, her mind lit
by her cold intellectual &ldquo;ethical&rdquo;&mdash;hooooo&mdash;the very
<em>sound</em> of the word&mdash;&ldquo;ethical Pantheism&rdquo;; cool and secret
and hateful. &ldquo;Rather a nice little thing&rdquo;; &ldquo;pretty green

But Mr. Hancock was already at the door. There
was only a glimpse of his unknown figure arrested for a
moment with its back to her as he pulled the door wide
enough to pass through. The door closed crisply behind
him and his crisp unhastening footsteps went away out
of hearing along the thickly carpeted hall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Dear</em> me!&rdquo; she breathed through firmly held lips,
standing up. Her blood was aflame. The thudding of her
heart shook the words upon her breath. She was fighting
against something more than amazement. She knew that
only part of her refused to believe. In a part of her brain
illumination leaving the shock already far away in the past,
was at work undisturbed, flowing rapidly down into thoughts
set neatly in the language of the world. She held them
back, occupying herself irrelevantly about the room, catching
back desperately at the familiar trains of revery suggested
by its objects; cancelling the incident and summoning
it again and again without prejudice or afterthought. Each
time the shock recurred unchanged, firmly registered, its
quality indubitable. She sat down at last to examine it
and find her thoughts. Taking a pencil in a trembling
hand she began carefully adding a long column of figures.
A system of adding that had been recommended to her by
the family mathematician now suggested itself for the first
time in connection with her own efforts....
</p>

<p>
How <em>dare</em> he?
</p>

<p>
It was deliberate. A brusque casual tone, deliberately
<a id="page-215" class="pagenum" title="215"></a>
put on; a tone he sometimes used to the boys downstairs,
or to cabmen. How did he dare to use it to her? It must
cease instantly. It was not to be suffered for a moment.
Not for a moment could she hold a position which would
entitle any one, particularly any man to speak to her in
that&mdash;outrageous&mdash;<em>official</em> tone. Why not? It was the
way of business people and officials all the world over....
Then he should have begun as he meant to go on....
I won&rsquo;t endure it now. No one has ever spoken to me in
that way&mdash;and no one shall, with impunity. I have been
fortunate. They have spoiled me.... I should never
have come if I had found they had that sort of tone. It
was his difference that made me come.

Those two had talked to him and made him think. The
aunt and cousins had prepared the way. But their hostility
had been harmless. These two had approved. That was
clear at the week-end. They must have chaffed him and
given him their blessing. Then, for the first time, he had
thought, sitting alone and pondering reasonably. It was
he himself who had drawn back. He was quite right. He
belonged to that side of society and must keep with them
and go their way. Very wise and right ... but damn his
insolent complacency....

&ldquo;Everything a professional man does, must stabilise his
position.&rdquo; Perhaps that is true. But then his business
relationships must be business relationships from the first
... that was expected. The wonder of the Wimpole
Street life was that it had not been so. Instead of an
employer there had been a sensitive isolated man; prosperous
and strong outwardly and as suffering and perplexed
in mind as any one could be. He had not hesitated to seek
sympathy.

He would have cynical thoughts. The truth was that

A woman always knows first. It was not clear until Babington.
But there was a sharp glimpse then. He must
have known how amazed they would be at his cycling over
after he had neglected them for years, on that one Sunday.
They had concealed their amazement from him. But it
was they who had revealed things. There was nothing
imaginary after that in taking one wild glance and leaving
things to go their way. Nothing. No one was to blame.
And now he knew and had considered and had made an absurd

The bell rang softly in its usual way. The incident had
been an accident; an illusion. Even so; she had been
prepared for it, without knowing she was prepared, otherwise
she would not have understood so fully and instantly.
If she had only imagined it, it had changed everything,
her interpretation of it was prophetic; just as before he
had not known where they were so now the rupture was
imminent whether he knew it or no. She found herself
going upstairs breathing air thick with pain. This was
dreadful.... She could not bear much of this.... The
patient had gone. He would be alone. They would be
alone. To be in his presence would be a relief ... this
was appalling. This pain could not be endured. The
sight of the room holding the six months would be intolerable.
She drew her face together, but her heart was beating
noisily. The knob of the door handle rattled in her trembling
hand ... large flat brass knob with a row of grooves
to help the grasp ... she had never observed that before.
The door opened before her. She flung it wider than
usual and pushed her way, leaving it open ... he was
standing impermanently with a sham air of engrossment
at his writing table and would turn on his heel and go
the moment she was fairly across the room. Buoyant with
pain she flitted through the empty air towards the distant
bracket-table. Each object upon it stood marvellously clear.
She reached it and got her hands upon the familiar instruments
... no sound; he had not moved. The flame of
the little spirit-lamp burned unwavering in the complete
stillness ... now was the moment to drop thoughts and
anger. Up here was something that had been made up here,
real and changeless and independent. The least vestige
of tumult would destroy it. It was something that no
one could touch; neither his friends nor he nor she. They
had not made it and they could not touch it. Nothing
had happened to it; and he had stood quietly there long
<a id="page-218" class="pagenum" title="218"></a>
enough for it to re-assert itself. Steadily with her hands
full of instruments she turned towards the sterilising tray.
The room was empty. Pain ran glowing up her arms from
her burden of nauseating relics of the needs of some complacent
patient ... the room was stripped, a west-end
surgery, among scores of other west-end surgeries, a prison
claiming her by the bonds of the loathsome duties she had
learned.

This letter must be the final explanation. She opened
it, standing by the hall table. &ldquo;Dear Miss Henderson&mdash;you
are very persistent.&rdquo; She folded the letter up and walked
rapidly out into the sunshine. The way down to the
Euston Road was very long and sunlit. It was radiant
with all the months and weeks and days. She thought of
going on with the unread letter and carrying it into the
surgery, tearing it up into the waste paper basket and
saying I have not read this. It is all right. We will not
talk any more. One thing would have gone. But there
would be a tremendous cheerfulness and independence
and the memory of the things in the other letters. The
letter once read two things would have gone, everything.
She paused at the corner of the gardens looking down at
the pavement. There was in some way that would not
come quite clear so much more at stake than personal
feelings about the insulting moment. It was something
that stuck into everything, made everything intolerable
until it was admitted and cancelled. As long as he went
on hedging and pretending it was not there there could
be no truth anywhere. It was something that must go out
of the world, no matter what it cost. It would be smiling
and cattish and behaving to drop it. Explained, it would
be wiped away, and everything else with it. To accept
his assertions would be to admit lack of insight. That
would be treachery. The continued spontaneity of manner
which it would ensure would be the false spontaneity that
<a id="page-220" class="pagenum" title="220"></a>
sat everywhere ... all over that woman getting into the
&rsquo;bus; brisk cheerful falsity. She glanced through to the
end of the letter ... &ldquo;foolish gossip which might end
by making your position untenable.&rdquo; <em>Idiot.</em> Charming
chivalrous gentleman.

<p class="tb">

<p class="noindent">
I want to have it both ways. To keep the consideration

me from gossip. To prove myself independent and truth-demanding
I would break up anything. That&rsquo;s damned
folly. Never mind. Why didn&rsquo;t he admit it at once?
He hated being questioned and challenged. He may have
thought that manner was &ldquo;the kindest way.&rdquo; It is not
for him to choose ways of treating me. This cancels the
past. But it admits it. Not to admit the past would be
to go on for ever in a false position. He still hides. But
he knows that I know he is hiding. Where we have been
we have been. It may have been through a false estimate
of me to begin with. That does not matter. Where we
have been we have been. That is not imagination. One
day he will know it is not imagination. There is something
that is making me very glad. A painful relief. Something
forcing me back upon something. There is something
that I have smashed, for some reason I do not know.
It&rsquo;s something in my temper, that flares out about things.

<span class="firstchar">... &ldquo;A</span>nd at fifty, when a woman is beginning to sit
down intelligently to life&mdash;behold, it is beginning
to be time to take leave....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That woman was an elderly woman of the world; but
a dear. She understood. She had spent her life in amongst
people, having a life of her own going on all the time;
looking out at something through the bars, whenever she
was alone and sometimes in the midst of conversations;
but no one would see it, but people who <em>knew</em>. And now
she was free to <a id="corr-62"></a>step out and there was hardly any time left.
But there was a little time. Women who <em>know</em> are quite
brisk at fifty. &ldquo;A man must never be silent with a woman
unless he wishes for the quiet development of a relationship
from which there is no withdrawing ... if ordinary social
intercourse cannot be kept up he must fly ... in silence
a man is an open book and unarmed. In speech with a
man a woman is at a disadvantage&mdash;because they speak
different languages. She may understand his. Hers he
will never speak nor understand. In pity, or from other
motives she must therefore, stammeringly, speak his. He
listens and is flattered and thinks he has her mental measure
when he has not touched even the fringe of her consciousness....
Outside the life relationship men and <a id="corr-63"></a>women
can have only conversational, and again conversational,
interchange.&rdquo; ... That&rsquo;s the truth about life. Men and
women never meet. Inside the life relationship you can
see them being strangers and hostile; one or the other
or both, completely alone. That was the world. Social
<a id="page-223" class="pagenum" title="223"></a>
life. In social life no one was alive but the lonely women
keeping up half-admiring half-pitying endless conversations
with men, with one little ironic part of themselves ...
until they were fifty and had done their share of social life.
But outside the world&mdash;one could be alive always. Fifty.
Thirty more years....

When I woke in the night I felt nothing but tiredness
and regret for having promised to go. Now, I never felt
so strong and happy. This is how Mag is feeling. Their
kettle is bumping on their spirit lamp too. She loves the
sound just in this way, the Sunday morning sound of the
kettle with the air full of coming bells and the doors opening&mdash;I&rsquo;m
half-dressed, without any effort&mdash;and shutting up and
down the streets is <em>perfect</em>, again, and again; at seven o&rsquo;clock
in the silence, with the air coming in from the Squares
smelling like the country is bliss. &ldquo;You know, little child,
you have an extraordinary capacity for happiness.&rdquo; I
suppose I have. Well; I can&rsquo;t help it.... I <em>am</em> frantically
frantically happy. I&rsquo;m up here alone, frantically happy.
Even Mag has to talk to Jan about the happy things. Then
they go, a little. The only thing to do is either to be silent
or make cheerful noises. Bellow. If you do that too much
people don&rsquo;t like it. You can only keep on making cheerful
noises if you are quite alone. Perhaps that is why people
in life are always grumbling at &lsquo;annoyances&rsquo; and things;
to hide how happy they are ... &ldquo;there is a dead level
of happiness all over the world&rdquo;&mdash;hidden. People go on
about things because they are always trying to remember
how happy they are. The worse things are the more
despairing they get, because they are so happy. You know
what I mean. It&rsquo;s there&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing else there....
But some people <em>know</em> more about it than others. Intelligent
people. I suppose I am intelligent. I can&rsquo;t <em>help</em> it. I don&rsquo;t
want to be different. Yes I do&mdash;oh Lord yes I <em>do</em>. Mag
knows. But she goes in amongst people and the complaints
<a id="page-224" class="pagenum" title="224"></a>
and the fuss and takes sides. But they both come out again;
to be by themselves and talk about it all ... they sit down
intelligently to life.... They do things that have nothing
to do with their circumstances. They were always doing
things like this all the year round. Spring and Summer
and Autumn and Winter things. They had done, for
years. The kind of things that made independent elderly
women, widows and spinsters who were free to go about,
have that look of intense appreciation ... &ldquo;a heart at
leisure from itself to soothe and sympathise&rdquo;; no, that
type was always inclined to revel in other people&rsquo;s troubles.
It was something more than that. Never mind. Come
on. Hurry up. <em>Oh</em>&mdash;for a man, oh for a man <em>oh</em> for a
man&mdash;<em>sion</em> in the skies.... Wot a big voice I&rsquo;ve got,

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;Cooooooo&mdash;ooo&mdash;er&mdash;Bill.&rdquo; The sudden familiar sound
came just above her head. Where was she? <em>What</em> a pity.
The boys had wakened her. Then she had been asleep!
It was perfect. The footsteps belonging to the voice had
passed along just above her head; nice boys, they could
not help chi-iking when they saw the sleeping figures, but
they did not mean to disturb. They had wakened her from
her first day-time sleep. Asleep! She had slept in broad
sunlight at the foot of the little cliff. Waking in the day
time is <em>perfect</em> happiness. To wake suddenly and fully,
nowhere; in paradise; and then to see sharply with large
clear strong eyes the things you were looking at when you
fell asleep. She lay perfectly still. Perhaps the girls were
asleep. Presently they would all be sitting up again and
she would have to begin once more the tiring effort to be
as clever as they were. But it would be a little different
now that they had all lain stretched out at the foot of the
cliffs asleep. She was changed. Something had happened
since she had fallen asleep disappointed in the east-coast
sea and the little low cliff, wondering why she could not
<a id="page-225" class="pagenum" title="225"></a>
see and feel them like the seas and cliffs of her childhood.
She could see and feel them now, as long as no one spoke
and the first part of the morning remained far away. She
closed her eyes and drifted drowsily back to the moment
of being awakened by the sudden cry. In the instant before
her mind had slid back and she had listened to the muffled
footsteps thudding along the turf of the low cliff above
her head, waiting angrily and anxiously for further disturbance,
she had been perfectly alive, seeing; perfect
things all round her, no beginning or ending ... there
had been moments like that, years ago, in gardens, by seas
and cliffs. Her mind wandered back amongst these;
calling up each one with perfect freshness. They were all
the same. In each one she had felt exactly the same;
outside life, untouched by anything, free. She had
thought they belonged to the past, to childhood and
youth. In childhood she had thought each time that
the world had just begun and would always be like
that; later on, she now remembered, she had always
thought when such a moment came that it would be the
last and clung to it with wide desperate staring eyes until
tears came and she had turned away from some great open
scene with a strong conscious body flooded suddenly by
a strong warm tide to the sad dark world to live for the
rest of her time upon a memory. But the moment she had
just lived was the same, it was exactly the <em>same</em> as the first
one she could remember, the moment of standing, alone,
in bright sunlight on a narrow gravel path in the garden
at Babington between two banks of flowers, the flowers
level with her face and large bees swinging slowly to and
fro before her face from bank to bank, many sweet smells
coming from the flowers and amongst them a strange
pleasant smell like burnt paper.... It was the same moment.
She saw it now in just the same way; not remembering
going into the garden or any end to being in the bright sun
between the blazing flowers, the two banks linked by the
slowly swinging bees, nothing else in the world, no house
<a id="page-226" class="pagenum" title="226"></a>
behind the little path, no garden beyond it. Yet she must
somehow have got out of the house and through the
shrubbery and along the plain path between the lawns.

All the six years at Babington were the blazing alley of
flowers without beginning or end, no winters, no times
of day or changes to be seen. There were other memories,
quarrelling with Harriett in the nursery, making paper
pills, listening to the bells on Sunday afternoon, a bell and
a pomegranate, a bell or a pomegranate round about the
hem of Aaron&rsquo;s robe, the squirting of water into one&rsquo;s
aching ear, the taste of an egg after scarlet fever, the
witch in the chimney, cowslip balls, a lobster walking upstairs
on its tail, dancing in a ring with grown-ups, the
smell of steam and soap the warm smell of the bath towel,
Martha&rsquo;s fingers warming one&rsquo;s feet, her lips kissing one&rsquo;s
back, something going to happen to-morrow, crackling green
paper clear like glass and a gold paper fringe in your hand
before the cracker went off; an eye blazing out of the wall
at night &ldquo;Thou God seest me,&rdquo; apple pasties in the garden;
coming up from the mud pies round the summer house
to bed, being hit on the nose by a swing and going indoors
screaming at the large blots of blood on the white pinafore,
climbing up the cucumber frame and falling through the
glass at the top, blowing bubbles in the hay-loft and singing
Rosalie the Prairie Flower, and whole pieces of life indoors
and out coming up bit by bit as one thought, but all mixed
with sadness and pain and bothers with people. They
did not come first or without thought. The blazing alley
came first without thought or effort of memory. The
flowers all shining separate and distinct and all together,
indistinct in a blaze. She gazed at them ... sweet Williams
of many hues, everlasting flowers gold and yellow and brown
and brownish purple, pinks and petunias and garden daisies
white and deep crimson ... then <em>memory</em> was happiness,
<a id="page-227" class="pagenum" title="227"></a>
one happiness linked to the next.... It was the same
already with Germany ... the sunny happy beautiful
things came first ... in a single glance the whole of the
time in Germany was beautiful, golden happy light, and
people happy in the golden light, garlands of music, and
the happy ringing certainty of voices, no matter what
they said, the way the whole of life throbbed with beauty
when the hush of prayers was on the roomful of girls ...
the wonderful house, great dark high wooden doors in the
distance thrown silently open, great silent space of sunlight
between them, high windows, alight against the
shadows of rooms; the happy confidence of the open
scene.... Germany was a party, a visit, a gift. It <em>had</em>
been, in spite of everything in the difficult life, what she
had dreamed it when she went off; all woods and forests
and music ... happy Hermann and Dorothea happiness
in the summer twilight of German villages. It had become
that now. The heart of a German town was that, making
one a little homesick for it.... The impulse to go and
the going had been right. It was part of something ...
with a meaning; perhaps there is happiness only in the
things one does deliberately, without a visible reason;
drifting off to Germany, because it called; coming here
to-day ... in freedom. If you are free you are alive ...
nothing that happens in the part of your life that is not
free, the part you do and are paid for, is alive. To-day,
because I am free I am the same person as I was when I
was there, but much stronger and happier because I know
it. As long as I can sometimes feel like this nothing has
mattered. Life is a chain of happy moments that cannot
die.

Was it nearly tea-time? Would either of them soon
mention tea? The beauty of the rocks had faded. Yet,
if they ceased being clever and spoke of the beauty, it would
not come back. The weariness of keeping things up went on.
When the gingernuts and lemonade were at last set out
upon the sand, they shamed Miriam with the sense of her
long preoccupation with them. The girls had not thought
of them. They never seemed to flag in their way of talking.
Perhaps it was partly their regular meals. It was dreadful
always to be the first one to want food....

Going alone for a moment in the twilight across the
little scrub, as soon as she had laughed enough over leaving
the room in the shelter of a gorse bush, she recovered the
afternoon&rsquo;s happiness. There was a little fence, bricks
were lying scattered about and half-finished houses stood
along the edge of the scrub. But a soft land-breeze was
coming across the common carrying the scent of gorse;
the silence of the sea reminded her of its presence beyond
the cliffs; her own gorse-scented breeze, and silent sea and
sunlit cliffs.

of yesterday giving a Sunday leisure to the usual
anxious hurry of breakfast. She was strong with her own
possessions. Wimpole Street held nothing but her contract
of duties to fulfil. These she could see in a clear vexatious
tangle, against the exciting on-coming of everybody&rsquo;s
summer; an excitement that was enough in itself. Patients
were pouring out of town&mdash;in a fortnight the Orlys would

In a month Mr. Hancock would go. For a month before

The little lavatory with its long high window sending
in the light from across the two sets of back to back tree-shaded
Bloomsbury gardens, its little shabby open sink
cupboard facing her with its dim unpolished taps and the
battered enamel cans on its cracked and blistered wooden
top became this morning one of her own rooms, a happy
little corner in the growing life that separated her from
Wimpole Street. There were no corners such as this in
<a id="page-230" class="pagenum" title="230"></a>
the beautiful clever Hampstead house; no remote shabby
happy corners at all; nothing brown and old and at peace.
Between him and his house were his housekeeper and servants;
between him and his life was his profession ...
and the complex group of people with whom he must
perpetually deal, with whom he dealt in alternations of
intimacy and formality. He was still at his best in his
practice. That was still his life. There was nothing more
real as yet in his life than certain times and moments in his
room at Wimpole Street.... Life had answered no other
questions for him.... His thought-life and his personal
life were troubled and dark and cold ... in spite of his
attachment to some of his family group ... he could
buy beautiful things, and travel freely in his leisure ...
perhaps that, those two glorious things, were sufficient
compensation. But there was something wrong about
them; they gave a false sense of power ... the way all
those people smiled at each other when they went about
and bought things, picked up a fine thing at a bargain,
or gave a price whose size they were proud of ... thinking
other people&rsquo;s thoughts ... apart from this worldly side
of his life, he was entirely at Wimpole Street; the whole
of him; an open book; there was nothing else in his life,
yet ... his holiday with those two men&mdash;even the soft-voiced
sensuous one who would quote poetry and talk
romantically and cynically about women in the evenings&mdash;would
bring nothing else. Yet he was counting upon it so
much that he could not help unbending about his boat
and his boots and his filters ... perhaps all that was the
best of the holiday&mdash;men were never tired of talking about
the way they did this and that ... clever difficult things
that made all the difference; but they missed all the
rest. Even when they sat about smoking their minds were
fussing. The women in their parties dressed, and smiled
and appreciated. There would be no real happiness in such
a party ... except when the women were alone, doing the
things with no show about them. Supposing I were able
<a id="page-231" class="pagenum" title="231"></a>
to go anywhere on this page ... Ippington ... 295m;
pop. 760 ... trains to Tudworth and thence two or three
times daily ... Spray Bay Hotel.... A sparrow cheeped
on the window sill and fluttered away. The breath of
happiness poured in at the high window; all the places
in the railway guide told over their charms; mountains
and lakes and rivers, innumerable strips of coast, village
streets to walk along for the first time, leading out ...
going, somewhere, in a train. Standing on tiptoe she
gazed her thoughts across the two garden spaces towards
the grimed backs of the large brown houses. Why was
one allowed to be so utterly happy? There it was ...
happily here and happily going away ... away.

and physically ... her development arrested in the interest
of her special functions ... reverting later towards the male
type ... old women with deep voices and hair on their
faces ... leaving off where boys of eighteen began. If
that is true everything is as clear as daylight. &ldquo;Woman is

is undeveloped man ... if one could die of the loathsome

The torment grew as the August weeks passed. There
were strange interesting things unexpectedly everywhere.
Streets of great shuttered houses, their window boxes
flowerless, all grey cool and quiet and untroubled on a day
of cool rain; the restaurants were no longer crowded;
torturing thought ranged there unsupported, goaded to
madness, just a mad feverish swirling in the head, ranging
out, driven back by the vacant eyes of little groups of
people from the country. Unfamiliar people appeared
in the parks and streets talking and staring eagerly about,
women in felt boat-shaped hats trimmed with plaid ribbons&mdash;Americans.
They looked clever&mdash;and ignorant of worrying
thoughts. Men carried their parcels. But it was just
the same. It was impossible to imagine these dried, yellow-faced
<a id="page-235" class="pagenum" title="235"></a>
women with babies. But if they liked all the fuss
and noise and talk as much as they seemed to do.... If
they did <em>not</em>, what were they doing? What was everybody
<em>doing</em>? So busily.

Sleeplessness and every day a worse feeling of illness.
Every day the new torture. Every night the dreaming
and tossing in the fierce, stifling, dusty heat, the awful
waking, to know that presently the unbearable human
sounds would begin again; the torment of walking through
the streets the solitary torment of leisure to read again in
the stillness of the office; the moments of hope of finding
a fresh meaning; hope of having misread.

There was nothing to turn to. Books were poisoned.
Art. All the achievements of men were poisoned at the
root. The beauty of nature was tricky femininity. The
animal world was cruelty. Humanity was based on cruelty.
Jests and amusements were tragic distractions from tragedy.
Religion was the only hope. But even there there was no
hope for women. No future life could heal the degradation
of having been a woman. Religion in the world had nothing
but insults for women. Christ was a man. If it was true
that he was God taking on humanity&mdash;he took on <em>male</em>
humanity ... and the people who explained him, St.
Paul and the priests, the Anglicans and the non-Conformists
it was the same story everywhere. Even if religion could
answer science and prove it wrong there was no hope, for
women. And no intelligent person can prove science
wrong. Life is poisoned, for women, at the very source.
Science is true and will find out more and more and things
will grow more and more horrible. Space is full of dead
worlds. The world is cooling and dying. Then why not
stop <em>now</em>?

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> room still had the same radiant air. Nothing
looked worn. There was not a spot anywhere. Bowls
of flowers stood about. The Coalport tea service was set
out on the little black table. The drawn-thread work
table cover.... She had arranged the flowers. That was
probably all she did; going in and out of the garden, in
the sun, picking flowers. The Artist&rsquo;s Model and The
Geisha and the Strand Musicals still lay about; the curious
new smell came from the inside of the piano. But there
was this dreadful tiredness. It was dreadful that the
tiredness should come nearer than the thought of Harriett.
A pallid worried disordered face looked back from the strip
of glass in the overmantel. No need to have looked.
Always now, away from London, there was this dreadful
realisation of fatigue, dreadful empty sense of worry and
hurry ... feeling so <em>strong</em> riding down through London,
everything dropping away, nothing to think of; off and
free, the holiday ahead, nothing but lovely, lonely freedom
all round one.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-25-2">

<p class="noindent">
Perhaps Harriett would be nervous and irritable. She
had much more reason to be. But even if she were it
would be no good. It would be impossible to conceal
this frightful fatigue and nervousness. Harriett <em>must</em>
understand at once how battered and abject one was.
And it was a misrepresentation. Harriett knew nothing of
all one had come from; all one was going to in the distance.
<a id="page-238" class="pagenum" title="238"></a>
Maddening.... Lovely; how rich and good they looked,
more honest than those in the London shops. Harriett or
Mrs. Thimm or Emma had ordered them from some confectioner
in Chiswick. Fancy being able to buy anything
like that without thinking. How well they went with the
black piano and the Coalport tea-service and the garden
light coming in. Gerald did not think that women were
inferior or that Harriett was a dependent.... But Gerald
did not think at all. He knew nothing was too good for
Harriett. Oo, <em>I</em> dunno, she would say with a laugh. She
thought all men were duffers. Perhaps that was the best
way. Selfish babies. But Gerald was not selfish. He
would never let Harriett wash up if he were there. He
would never pretend to be ignorant of &lsquo;mysteries&rsquo; to get
out of doing things. I get out of doing things&mdash;in houses.
But women won&rsquo;t let me do things. They all know I
want to be mooning about. How do they know it? What
is it? But they like me to be there. And now in houses
there&rsquo;s always this fearful worry and tiredness. What is
the meaning of it?
</p>

<p>
Heavy footsteps came slowly downstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I put tea indoors. I thought Miss Miriam&rsquo;d be warm
after her ride.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A large undulating voice with a shrewd consoling glance
in it. She must have come to the kitchen door to meet
Harriett in the hall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ke spect she will.&rdquo; It was the same voice she
had had in the nursery, resonant with practice in speaking
to new people. Miriam felt tears coming.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, you porking? Isn&rsquo;t it porking?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simply porked to death my dear. Porked to <em>Death</em>&rdquo;
bawled Miriam softly, refreshed and delighted. Harriett
was still far off, but she felt as if she had touched her.
Even the end of the awful nine months was not changing
her. Her freshly shampooed hair had a leisurely glint.
There was colour in her cheeks. She surreptitiously rubbed
her own hot face. Her appearance would improve now with
<a id="page-239" class="pagenum" title="239"></a>
every hour. By the evening she would be her old self.
After tea she would play The Artist&rsquo;s Model and The
Geisha.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have tea. I was asleep. I didn&rsquo;t hear you come.&rdquo;
She sank into one of the large chairs, her thin accordion
pleated black silk tea-gown billowing out round her squared
little body. Even her shoulders looked broader and squarer.
From the little pleated white chiffon chemisette her
radiant firm little head rose up, her hair glinting under
the light of the window behind her. She looked so fine&mdash;such
a &ldquo;fine spectacle&rdquo;&mdash;and seemed so strong. How did
she feel? Mrs. Thimm brought the teapot. The moment
she had gone Harriett handed the rich cakes. Mrs. Thimm
<em>beaming</em>, shedding strong beams of happiness and approval....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on&rdquo; said Harriett. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tuck in. There&rsquo;s
some thin bread and butter somewhere but I can&rsquo;t eat
anything but these things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The last time I went up to town Mrs. Bollingdon and
I had six between us at Slater&rsquo;s and when we got back we
had another tea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fancy <em>you</em>!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know. I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;<em>elp</em> it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp it, Micky. <em>Love</em>lay b-hird.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fourth cup of creamy tea; Harriett&rsquo;s firm ringed
hand; the gleaming serene world; the sunlit flower-filled
garden shaded at the far end by the large tree the
other side of the fence coming in, one with the room;
the sun going to set and bring the evening freshness and
rise to-morrow. Twenty-eight leisurely teas, twenty-eight
long days; a feeling of strength and drowsiness. Nothing
to do but clean the bicycle and pump up the tyres on the
lawn, to-morrow. Nothing&mdash;after carrying the bicycle
from the coal cellar up the area steps and through the house
into the Tansley Street back yard. Nothing more but
setting out after two nights of sleep in a cool room.

&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re going a sixty mile ride on it I advise

<p>
&ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s happy,&rdquo; said Harriett as Gerald&rsquo;s white
flannelled figure flashed into the sunlight and disappeared
through the yard gate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ph&mdash;how hot it is; it&rsquo;s this summer-house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go outside if you like,&rdquo; said Miriam lazily, &ldquo;it
seems to me simply perfect in here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right&mdash;ph&mdash;it&rsquo;s hot everywhere,&rdquo; said Harriett
languidly. She mopped her face. Her face emerged from
her handkerchief fever-flushed, the eyes large and dark and
brilliant; her lips full and drawn in and down at the corners
with a look of hopeless anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Anger flushed through Miriam. Harriett at nineteen,
in the brilliant beauty of the summer afternoon facing
hopeless fear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an awfully pretty dress&rdquo; she faltered nervously.
</p>

<p>
Harriett set her lips and stretched both arms along the
elbows of her basket chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You could have it made into an evening gown.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I loathe the very sight of it. I shall burn it the minute
I&rsquo;ve done with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was awful that anything that looked so charming could
seem like that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you feel bad? Is it so awful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, but I feel as if I were bursting. I wish
it would just hurry up and be over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re simply splendid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I simply don&rsquo;t think about it. You don&rsquo;t think about
<a id="page-241" class="pagenum" title="241"></a>
it except now and again when you realise you&rsquo;ve got to go
through it and then you go hot all over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The head&rsquo;s a bit wobbly,&rdquo; said Gerald riding round the
lawn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does that matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier to ride, especially
with this great bundle on the handle-bars. You want a
luggage-carrier.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay. I say Gerald, show me the nuts to-morrow,
not now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The machine was lying upside down on the lawn with
its back wheel revolving slowly in the air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The front wheel&rsquo;s out of the true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think of the saddle?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The saddle&rsquo;s all right enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Brooks&rsquo;s, B. 40; about the best you can have.
It&rsquo;s my own and so&rsquo;s the Lucas&rsquo;s Baby bell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, she&rsquo;s got an adjustable spanner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not mine nor the repair outfit; Mr. Leyton
lent me those.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And vaseline on the bearings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of your gear-case, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gerald, do you think it&rsquo;s all right on the whole?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s sound enough as far as I can see; bit squiffy
and wobbly. I don&rsquo;t advise you to ride it in traffic or with

<p>
&ldquo;I <em>must</em> have the bundle. I came down through Tottenham

off at the level crossing she found that her skirt was sodden
and her zouave spangled all over with beads of moisture.
She walked shivering across the rails and remounted rapidly,

The cyclist smiled as he shouted back. He knew she
knew. But he liked shouting too. If she had yelled Have
you got a <em>soul</em>, it would have been just the same. If everyone
were on bicycles all the time you could talk to everybody,
all the time, about anything ... sailing so steadily
along with two free legs ... how much easier it must
be with your knees going so slowly up and down ... how
<em>funny</em> I must look with my knees racing up and down in
lumps of skirt. But I&rsquo;m here, at the midday rest. It must
be nearly twelve.

<p>
Drawing into the curb near a confectioner&rsquo;s she thought
of buying two bars of plain chocolate. There <em>was</em> some sort
of truth in the Swiss Family Robinson. If you went on,
it was all right. There was only death. People frightened
you about things that were not there. I will never listen
to anybody again; or be frightened. That cyclist knew,
as long as he was on his bicycle. Perhaps he has people
who make him not himself. He can always get away again.
Men can always get away. I am going to lead a man&rsquo;s life
always getting away....
</p>

<p>
Wheeling her machine back to the open road she sat down
on a bank and ate the cold sausage and bread and half of the
chocolate and lay down to rest on a level stretch of grass
in front of a gate. Light throbbed round the edges of the
little high white fleecy clouds. She swung triumphantly
up. The earth throbbed beneath her with the throbbing
of her heart ... the sky steadied and stood further off,
<a id="page-244" class="pagenum" title="244"></a>
clear peaceful blue with light neat soft bunches of cloud
drifting slowly across it. She closed her eyes upon the
dazzling growing distances of blue and white and felt the
horizon folding down in a firm clear sweep round her green
cradle. Within her eyelids fields swung past green, cornfields
gold and black, fields with coned clumps of harvested
corn, dusty gold, and black, on either side of the bone-white
grass trimmed road. The road ran on and on lined
by low hedges and the strange everlasting back-flowing
fields. Thrilling hedges and outstretched fields of distant
light, coming on mile after mile, winding off, left behind
... &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the Bath Road I shall be riding on; I&rsquo;m going
down to Chiswick to see which way the wind is on the
Bath Road....&rdquo; Trees appeared golden and green and
shadowy with warm cool strong shaded trunks coming
nearer and larger. They swept by, their shadowy heads
sweeping the lower sky. Poplars shot up drawing her eyes
to run up their feathered slimness and sweep to the top of
the pointed plumes piercing the sky. Trees clumped in
masses round houses leading to villages that shut her into
little corridors of hard hot light ... the little bright
sienna form of the hen she had nearly run over; the land
stretching serenely out again, rolling along, rolling along
in the hot sunshine with the morning and evening freshness
at either end ... sweeping it slowly in and out of the
deeps of the country night ... eyelids were transparent.
It was <em>light</em> coming through one&rsquo;s eyelids that made that
clear soft buff; soft buff light filtering through one&rsquo;s body
... little sounds, insects creeping and humming in the
hedge, sounds from the grass. Sudden single quiet sounds
going up from distant fields and farms, lost in the sky.

it wobble and being able to control it ... being able to
<a id="page-245" class="pagenum" title="245"></a>
look about easily ... there will be a harvest moon this
month, rolling up huge and hot, suddenly over the edge
of a field; the last moon. I shall see that anyhow whatever
the holiday is like. It will be cold again in the winter.
Perhaps I shan&rsquo;t feel so cold this winter.

She recognised the figure the instant she saw it. It was
as if she had been riding the whole day to meet it. Completely
forgotten it had been all the time at the edge of
the zest of her ride. It had been everywhere all the time
and there it was at last dim and distant and unmistakable
... coming horribly along, a murk in the long empty
road. She slowed up looking furtively about. The road
had been empty for so long. It stretched invisibly away
behind, empty. There was no sound of anything coming
along; nothing but the squeak squeak of her gear-case;
bitter empty fields on either side, greying away to the twilight,
the hedges sharp and dark, enemies; nothing ahead
but the bare road, carrying the murky figure; there all
the time; and bound to come. She rode on at her usual
pace struggling for an absorption so complete as to make
her invisible, but was held back by her hatred of herself
for having wondered whether he had seen her. The figure
was growing more distinct. Murky. Murk from head
to foot. Wearing openly like a coat the expression that
could be seen hidden inside everybody. She had made an
enemy of him. It was too late. The voice in her declaring
sympathy, claiming kinship faded faint and far away within
her ... hullo old boy, isn&rsquo;t it a bloody world ... he
would know it had come too late. He came walking along,
slowly walking like someone in a procession or a quickly
moving funeral; like someone in a procession, who must
go on. He was surrounded by people, pressed in and down
by them, wanting to kill everyone with a look and run,
madly, to root up trees and tear down the landscape and
<a id="page-246" class="pagenum" title="246"></a>
get outside ... he is myself.... He stood still. Her
staring eyes made him so clear that she saw his arrested face
just before he threw out an arm and came on, stumbling.
Measuring the width of the roadway she rode on slowly
along the middle of it, pressing steadily and thoughtlessly
forward, her eyes fixed on the far-off spaces of the world
she used to know, towards a barrier of swirling twilight.
He was quite near, slouching and thinking and silently
talking, on and on. He was all right poor thing. She put
forth all her strength and shot past him in a sharp curve,
her eye just seeing that he turned and stood, swaying.
</p>

<p>
What a blessing he was drunk what a blessing he was
drunk she chattered busily, trying to ignore her trembling
limbs. Again and again as she steadied and rode sturdily
and blissfully on came the picture of herself saying with
confidential eagerness as she dismounted &ldquo;I <em>say</em>&mdash;make
haste&mdash;there&rsquo;s a madman coming down the road&mdash;get
behind the hedge till he&rsquo;s gone&mdash;I&rsquo;m going for the police.&rdquo;
A man would not have been afraid. Then men <em>are</em> more
independent than women. Women can never go very far
from the protection of men&mdash;because they are physically
inferior. But men are afraid of mad bulls.... They have
to resort to tricks. What was that I was just thinking?
Something I ought to remember. Women have to be
protected. But men explain it the wrong way. It was
the same thing.... The polite protective man was the
same; if he relied on his strength. The world is the most
sickening hash.... I&rsquo;m so sorry for you. I hate humanity
too. <em>Isn&rsquo;t</em> it a lovely day? <em>Isn&rsquo;t</em> it? Just look.

The dim road led on into the darkness of what appeared
to be a private estate. The light from the lamp fell upon
wide gates fastened back. The road glimmered on ahead
with dense darkness on either side. There had been no
turning. The road evidently passed through the estate.
<a id="page-247" class="pagenum" title="247"></a>
She rode on and on between the two darknesses, her light
casting a wobbling radiance along her path. Rustling
sounded close at hand, and quick thuddings startled her
making her heart leap. The hooting of an owl echoed
through the hollows amongst the trees. Stronger than
fear was the comfort of the dense darkness. Her own
darkness by <a id="corr-66"></a>right of riding through the day. Leaning
upon the velvety blackness she pushed on, her eyes upon
the little circle of light, steady on the centre of the pathway,
wobbling upon the feet of the trees emerging in slow
procession on either side of the way.

The road began to slope gently downwards. Wearily
back-pedalling she crept down the incline her hand on the
brake, her eyes straining forward. Hard points of gold
light&mdash;of course. She had put them there herself. Marlborough
... the prim polite lights of Marlborough;
little gliding moving lights, welcoming, coming safely up
as she descended. They disappeared. There must have
been a gap in the trees. Presently she would be down
among them.

She passed through the open gate into the glimmer of
a descending road. Yes. Why not? Why that amazed
stupefaction? Trying to rob her of the darkness and the
wonderful coming out into the light. The man&rsquo;s voice
went on with her down the dull safe road. A young lady,
taking a bicycle ride in a daylit suburb. That was what
she was. That was all he would allow. It&rsquo;s something
in men.

&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think of riding up over the downs at this
time of night?&rdquo; It was like an At home. Everybody in
<a id="page-248" class="pagenum" title="248"></a>
the shop was in it, but she was not in it. Marlborough
thoughts rattling in all the heads; with Sunday coming.
They had sick and dying relations. But it was all in Marlborough.
Marlborough was all round them all the time,
the daily look of it, the morning coming each day excitingly,
all the people seeing each other again and the day
going on. They did not know that that was it; or what
it was they liked. Talking and thinking with the secret
hidden all the time even from themselves. But it was
that that made them talk and make such a to do about
everything. They had to hide it because if they knew
they would <em>feel</em> fat and complacent and wicked. They
were fat and complacent because they did not know it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes I do,&rdquo; said Miriam in feeble husky tones.
</p>

<p>
She stood squarely in front of the grating. The people
became angry gliding forms; cheated; angry in an eternal
resentful silence; pretending. The man began thoughtfully
ticking off the words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How far have you come&rdquo; he said suddenly pausing
and looking up through the grating.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve just come down through the Forest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that a forest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must have come through Savernake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was a forest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t advise you to go on up over the downs
at this time of night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If only she had not come in she could have gone on
without knowing it was &ldquo;the downs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My front tyre is punctured&rdquo; she said conversationally,
leaning a little against the counter.
</p>

<p>
The man&rsquo;s face tightened. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mr. Drake next
door would mend that for you in the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Next door. Oh, thank you.&rdquo; Pushing her sixpence
under the rail she went down the shop to the door seeing
nothing but the brown dusty floor leading out to the helpless
night.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-249" class="pagenum" title="249"></a>
Why did he keep making such impossible suggestions?
The tyre was absolutely flat. How much would a hotel
cost? How did you stay in hotels ... hotels ... her
hands went busily to her wallet. She drew out the repair
outfit and Mr. Leyton&rsquo;s voice sounded, emphatic and
argumentative &ldquo;You know where you are and they don&rsquo;t
rook you.&rdquo; There was certain to be one in a big town like
this. She swished back into the shop and interrupted the
man with her eager singing question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; came the answer, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a quiet place of that
sort up the road, right up against the Forest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has my telegram gone? Can I alter it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not gone, you&rsquo;re just in time.&rdquo;

Someone brought in the meal and clattered it quietly
down, going away and shutting the door without a word.
A door opened and the sound of departing footsteps ceased.
She was shut in with the meal and the lamp in the little
crowded world. The musty silence was so complete that
the window hidden behind the buff and white blinds and
curtains must be shut. The silence throbbed. The
throbbing of her heart shook the room. Something was
telling the room that she was the happiest thing in existence.
She stood up, the beloved little room moving as she moved,
and gathered her hands gently against her breast, to ...
get through, through into the soul of the musty little
room.... &ldquo;Oh....&rdquo; She felt herself beating from head
to foot with a radiance, but her body within it was weak
and heavy with fever. The little scene rocked, crowding
furniture, antimacassars, ornaments, wool mats. She
looked from thing to thing with a beaming, feverish, frozen
smile. Her eyes blinked wearily at the hot crimson flush
of the mat under the lamp. She sank back again her heavy
<a id="page-250" class="pagenum" title="250"></a>
light limbs glowing with fever. &ldquo;By Jove, I&rsquo;m tired....
I&rsquo;ve had nothing since breakfast m&mdash;but a m-bath bun
and an acidulatudd <em>drop</em>.&rdquo; ... She laughed and sat whistling
softly ... Jehoshophat&mdash;Manchester&mdash;Mesopotamia&mdash;beloved&mdash;you
sweet sweet thing&mdash;Veilchen, unter Gras
versteckt&mdash;out of it all&mdash;here I am. I shall always stay in
hotels.... Glancing towards the food spread out on a
white cloth near the globed lamp she saw beyond the table
a little stack of books. Ham and tea and bread and butter....
Leaning unsteadily across the table ... battered and
ribbed green binding and then a short moral story or
natural history&mdash;blue, large and fat, a &lsquo;story-book&rsquo; of
some kind ... she drew out one of the undermost volumes....
&ldquo;Robert Elsmere&rdquo;! Here, after all these years in this
little outlandish place. She poured out some tea and
hurriedly slid a slice of ham between two pieces of bread
and butter and sat back with the food drawn near, the
lamplight glaring into her eyes, the printed page in exciting
shadow. Everything in the room was distinct and sharp,&mdash;morning
strength descended upon her.

of sinking through the bed. Never mind. I&rsquo;ve done the
ride. I&rsquo;m alive and alone in a strange place. Everything&rsquo;s
alive all round me in a new way. Nearer. As the flame of
the candle had swelled and gone out under her blowing
she had noticed the bareness of everything in the room&mdash;a
room for chance travellers, nothing that anyone could
carry away. She could still see it as it was when she moved
and blew out the candle, a whole room swaying sideways
into darkness. The more she relinquished the idea of harm
and danger, the nearer and more intimate the room became....
No one can prevent my being alone in a strange place,

Miriam tried to return to the falling rain, the soft
light in it, the soft light on the greenery, the intense green
glow everywhere ... misty green glow. But her eyes
fell and her thoughts went on. They would have seen.
Her face must be speaking of their niceness in coming out
on the dull day so that she might drive about once more
in Lord Lansdowne&rsquo;s estate. Someone will speak. Perhaps
they had not found forgetfulness in the green through
the rain under the grey. Moments came suddenly in the
lanes between the hedges, like that moment that always
came where the lane ran up and turned and the fields
spread out in the distance. But usually you could not
forget the chaise and the donkey and the people. In here
amongst the green something always came at once and
stayed. Perhaps they did not find it so, or did not know
they found it, because of their thoughts about the &ldquo;fine
estate.&rdquo; They seemed quite easy driving in the lanes, as
easy as they ever seemed when one could not forget them.
What were they doing when one forgot them? They knew
one liked some things better than others; or suddenly
liked everything very much indeed ... she said you were
apathetic ... what does that mean ... what did she
mean ... with her one could see nothing and sat waiting
... I said I don&rsquo;t think so, I don&rsquo;t think she is apathetic
at all. Then they understood when one sat in a heap....
<a id="page-253" class="pagenum" title="253"></a>
They had been pleased this morning because of one&rsquo;s misery
at going away. They did not know of the wild happiness
in the garden before breakfast nor that the garden had been
so lovely because the strain of the visit was over, and London
was coming. They did not know that the happiness of being
in amongst the greenery to-day, pouring out one&rsquo;s heart
in farewell to the great trees had grown so intense because
the feeling of London and freedom was there. They could
not see the long rich winter, the lectures and books, out of
which something was coming....

Miriam looked about the boudoir. Mrs. Green had
hardly looked at her. She was smiling at her fancy work.
But if one did not say something soon she would speak
again, going on into things from her point of view. Doctor
and medicine. Eve liked it all. She <em>liked</em> Mrs. Green&rsquo;s
clever difficult fancy work and the boudoir smell of Turkish
beans and the house and garden and the bazaars and village
entertainments and the children&rsquo;s endless expensive clothes
and the excitements and troubles about that fat man.
Down here she was in a curious flush of excitement all the
time herself....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think she wants a rest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told her so. But resting seems to make her worse.
We all thought she was worse after the holidays.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam&rsquo;s eyes fell before the sudden glance of Mrs.
Green&rsquo;s blue green eye. She must have seen her private
<a id="page-254" class="pagenum" title="254"></a>
vision of life in the great rich house ... misery, death
with no escape. But they had Eve. Eve did not know what
was killing her. She liked being tied to people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is very nervous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I know it&rsquo;s only nerves. I&rsquo;ve told her that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know what nerves are. They&rsquo;re not just
nothing....&rdquo;

<p>
&ldquo;<em>You&rsquo;re</em> not nervous.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Not in the way Hendie is. You&rsquo;re a solid little person.&rdquo;

Miriam laughed and thought of Germany and Newlands
and Banbury Park. But this house would be a thousand
times worse. There was no one in it who knew anything
about anything. That was why when she was not too
bad Eve thought it was good for her to be there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s very happy here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think that. But something must be done.
She can&rsquo;t go on with these perpetual headaches and sleeplessness
and attacks of weepiness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think she wants a long rest.&rdquo;

<p>
&ldquo;What does she do with her holidays? Doesn&rsquo;t she rest

&ldquo;Yes, but there are always <em>worries</em>&rdquo; said Miriam desperately.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very nice for him. I expect the little grandson

&ldquo;I expect you spend a good deal of your time with your
sisters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;it&rsquo;s a fearful distance.&rdquo; Why didn&rsquo;t you ask
me all these things when I was staying with you. There&rsquo;s
no time now....

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like living alone in London?&rdquo;

</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect you are. I think it&rsquo;s wonderful. But you must
be awfully lonely sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam fidgeted and wondered how to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;come down and see us again. I&rsquo;m glad I had
this chance of talking to you about Hendie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;ll be better in the winter. I think she&rsquo;s
really better in the cold weather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;we&rsquo;ll hope so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Green getting up.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s the matter with her. There&rsquo;s nothing
to worry her down here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&rdquo; said Miriam emphatically in a worldly tone of
departure. &ldquo;Thank you so much for having me&rdquo; she
said feebly as they passed through the flower-scented hall
the scent of the flowers hanging delicately within the
stronger odour of the large wood-fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came. We thought it would be nice for
both of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes it was very kind of you. I&rsquo;m sure she wants a
complete rest.&rdquo; Away from us away from you in some
new place....
</p>

<p>
In the open light of the garden Mrs. Green&rsquo;s eyes were
almost invisible points. She ought to do her hair smaller.
The fashionable bundle of little sausages did not suit a
large head. The eyes looked more sunken and dead than
Eve&rsquo;s with her many headaches. But she was strong&mdash;a
strong hard thunder-cloud at breakfast. Perhaps very
unhappy. But wealthy. Strong, cruel wealth, eating up
lives it did not understand. How did Eve manage to read
Music and Morals and Olive Schreiner here?

&ldquo;No miss&mdash;nobody.&rdquo;

Miriam went in briskly.... &ldquo;Well? How is the decayed
gentlewoman?&rdquo; she said briskly from the doorway. She
hardly looked. She had taken in the close-fitting bonnet
and chin bow and the height-giving look of the long blue
uniform cloak together with the general aspect of the heavily
shaded afternoon room....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s very well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear had stood quite still in her place half way
down the room between the sofa and the littered waiting
room table. She made a small controlled movement with
her right hand as Miriam approached. Miriam paused with
her hand on a &ldquo;Navy League,&rdquo; absorbed in the low sweet
even tone. She found herself standing reverently, pulled
up a few inches from the dark figure. Suddenly she was
alight with the radiance of an uncontrollable smile. Her
downcast eyes were fixed upon a tall slender figure in a
skimpy black dress, tendrils of fine gold hair dancing in the
rough wind under a cornflower blue toque, a clear living
rose-flush.... Something making one delicate figure more
than the open width of the afternoon, the blue afternoon
sea and sky. She looked up. The shy sweet flower pink
face glowed more intensely under the cap of gold hair
clasped flatly down by the blue velvet rim of the bonnet.
The eyes, now like Weymouth Bay, now like Julia Doyle&rsquo;s,
now a clear expressionless blue, were fixed on hers; the
<a id="page-257" class="pagenum" title="257"></a>
hesitating face was breaking again into watchful speech.
But there was no speech in the well-remembered outlines
moulding the ominous cloak. Miriam flung out to stem
the voice, rushing into phrases to open the way to the hall
and the front door. Miss Dear stood smiling and laughing
her little smothered obsequious laugh, just as she had
done at Bognor, making one feel like a man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;m most frightfully busy,&rdquo; wound up Miriam
cheerfully turning to the door. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s London&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
it? One never has a minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear did not move. &ldquo;I came to thank you for the
concert tickets,&rdquo; she said in the even thoughtful voice
that dispersed one&rsquo;s thoughts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes. Was it any good?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I enjoyed it immensely,&rdquo; said Miss Dear gravely. &ldquo;So
did Sister North,&rdquo; she added, shaking out the words in
delicate laughter.
</p>

<p>
... <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t know &lsquo;Sister <em>North</em>.&rsquo; ... &ldquo;Oh, good,&rdquo;
said Miriam opening the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was most kind of you to send them. I&rsquo;m going to
a case to-morrow, but I shall hope to see you when I come
back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sister North sported a swell new blouse&rdquo; said Miss
Dear in clear intimate tones as she paused in the hall to
take up her umbrella.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t rain,&rdquo; said Miriam formally, opening
the front door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was no <em>end</em> of a swell&rdquo; pursued Miss Dear, hitching
her cloak and skirt from her heels with a neat cuffed gloved
hand, quirked compactly against her person just under her
waist and turned so that her elbow and forearm made a
small compact angle against her person. She spoke over
her shoulder, her form slenderly poised forward to descend
the steps; &ldquo;I told her she would knock them.&rdquo; She was
aglow with the afternoon sunlight streaming down the street.
</p>

<p>
Miriam spoke as she stepped down with delicate plunges.
She did not hear and paused turning on the last step.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-258" class="pagenum" title="258"></a>
&ldquo;It was too <em>bad</em> of you&rdquo; shouted Miriam smiling &ldquo;to
leave my sister alone at the Decayed Gentlewomen&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help myself,&rdquo; gleamed Miss Dear. &ldquo;My
time was up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you <em>hate</em> being there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear hung, poised and swaying to some inner
breeze. Miriam gazed, waiting for her words, watching
the in-turned eyes control the sweet lips flowering for
speech.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was rather comical&rdquo;&mdash;the eyes came round, clear
pure blue;&mdash;&ldquo;until your sister came.&rdquo; The tall slender
figure faced the length of the street; the long thin blue
cloak flickering all over gave Miriam a foresight of the
coming swift hesitating conversational progress of the figure
along the pavement, the poise of the delicate surmounting
head, slightly bent, the pure brow foremost, shading the
lowered thoughtful eyes, the clear little rounded dip of
the chin indrawn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she gave me your address,&rdquo; finished Miss
Dear a little furrow running along her brow in control of
the dimpling flushed oval below it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say au revoir
and not good bye for the present.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good bye,&rdquo; flung Miriam stiffly at the departing face.
Shutting the neglected door she hurried back through the
hall and resumed her consciousness of Wimpole Street with
angry, eager swiftness.... Eve, getting mixed up with
people ... it is right ... <em>she</em> would not have been angry
if I had asked her to be nice to somebody.... I did not
mean to do anything ... I was proud of having the
tickets to send ... if I had not sent them I should have
had the thought of all those nurses, longing for something
to do between cases. They are just the people for the
Students Concerts ... if she comes again.... &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
have social life, unfortunately,&rdquo; how furious I shall feel
saying that &ldquo;you see I&rsquo;m so fearfully full up&mdash;lectures every
night and I&rsquo;m away every week end ... and I&rsquo;m not
supposed to see people here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">iriam</span> had no choice but to settle herself on the
cane-seated chair. When Miss Dear had drawn
the four drab coloured curtains into place the small cubicle
was in semi-darkness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope the next time you come to tea with me it will
be under rather more comfortable circumstances.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is all right,&rdquo; said Miriam in abstracted impatient
continuation of her abounding manner. Miss Dear was
arranging herself on the bed as if for a long sitting. The
small matter of business would come now. Having had
tea it would be impossible to depart the moment the discussion
was over. How much did the tea cost here? That
basement tea-room, those excited young women and middle-aged
women watchful and stealthy and ugly with poverty
and shifts, those tea-pots and shabby trays and thick bread
and butter were like the Y.W.C.A. public restaurant at the
other end of the street&mdash;fourpence at the outside; but
Miss Dear would have to pay it. She felt trapped ... &ldquo;a
few moments of your time to advise me&rdquo; and now half
the summer twilight had gone and she was pinned in this
prison face to face with anything Miss Dear might choose
to present; forced by the presences audible in the other
cubicles to a continuation of her triumphant tea-room
manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must excuse my dolly.&rdquo; She arranged her skirt
neatly about the ankle of the slippered bandaged foot.
</p>

<p>
Anyone else would say what is the matter with your
foot.... It stuck out, a dreadfully padded mass, dark
<a id="page-260" class="pagenum" title="260"></a>
in the darkness of the dreadful little enclosure in the
dreadful dark hive of women, collected together only by
poverty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you <em>left</em> your association?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh <em>no</em>, de-er; not <em>permanently</em> of course,&rdquo; said Miss
Dear pausing in her tweakings and adjustments of draperies
to glance watchfully through the gloom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still a member there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got to look <em>after</em> myself. They don&rsquo;t give you
a chance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rush in and rush out and rush in and rush out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you going to do? ... what do you want
with me....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean de-er.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I mean, are you going on nursing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of <em>course</em> de-er. I was going to tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam&rsquo;s restive anger would not allow her to attend
fully to the long story. She wandered off with the dreadful
idea of nursing a &ldquo;semi-mental&rdquo; sitting in a deck-chair
in a country garden, the hopeless patient, the nurse half
intent on a healthy life and fees for herself, and recalled
the sprinkling of uniformed figures amongst the women
crowded at the table, all in this dilemma, all eagerly intent;
all overworked by associations claiming part of their fees
or taking the risks of private nursing, all getting older;
all anyhow as long as they went on nursing bound to live
on illness; to live with illness knowing that they were
living on it. Yet Mr. Leyton had said that no hospital
run by a religious sisterhood was any good ... these
women were run by doctors....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see de-er it&rsquo;s the best thing any sensible nurse can
do as soon as she knows a sufficient number of influenchoo
peopoo&mdash;physicians and others.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo; ... But what has all this to do with
me....
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-261" class="pagenum" title="261"></a>
&ldquo;I shall keep in correspondence with my doctors and
friends and look <em>after</em> myself a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; said Miriam eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <em>splendid</em>
plan. What did you want to consult me about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well you see it&rsquo;s like this. I must tell you my little
difficulty. The folks at thirty-three don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m here
and I don&rsquo;t want to go back there just at present. I was
wondering if when I leave here you&rsquo;d mind my having
my box sent to your lodgings. I shan&rsquo;t want my reserve
things down there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t much <em>room</em> in my room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a flat box. I got it to go to the Colonies with a
patient.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Oh</em>, did you go?...&rdquo; Nurses did see life; though
they were never free to see it in their own way. Perhaps
some of them ... but then they would not be good
nurses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I didn&rsquo;t <em>go</em>. It was a chance of a life-time. Such
a de-er old gentleman&mdash;one of the Fitz-Duff family. It
would have been nurse companion. He didn&rsquo;t want me
in uniform. My word. He gave me a complete outfit,
<em>took</em> me round, coats and skirts at Peters, gloves at Penberthy&rsquo;s,
a <em>lovely</em> gold-mounted umbrella, everything the
heart could desire. He treated me just like a daughter.&rdquo;
During the whole of this speech she redeemed her words
by little delicate bridling movements and adjustments, her
averted eyes resting in indulgent approval on the old gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He <em>died</em> dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh I see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It could go under your bed, out of the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got hat-boxes and things. My room is full of things
I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps your landlady would let it stand somewhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I might ask her&mdash;won&rsquo;t they let you leave things here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They <em>would</em> I daresay,&rdquo; frowned Miss Dear &ldquo;but I
<a id="page-262" class="pagenum" title="262"></a>
have special reasons. I don&rsquo;t wish to be beholden to the
people here.&rdquo; She patted the tendrils of her hair, looking
about the cubicle with cold disapproval.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay Mrs. Bailey wouldn&rsquo;t mind. But I hardly
like to ask her you know. There seems to be luggage piled
up everywhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I should be prepared to pay a fee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
... What a wonderful way of living ... dropping a
trunk full of things and going off with a portmanteau;
starting life afresh in a new strange place. Miriam regarded
the limber capable form outstretched on the narrow bed.
This dark little enclosure, the forced companionship of the
crowd of competing adventuresses, the sounds of them
in the near cubicles, the perpetual sound filling the house
like a sea of their busy calculations ... all this was only
a single passing incident ... beyond it were the wide
well-placed lives of wealthy patients.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Younger is a sweet woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam&rsquo;s eyes awoke to affronted surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know de-er; the wan yow was sitting by at tea-time.
I told you just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; said Miriam guiltily.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear dropped her voice; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s told me her whole
story. She&rsquo;s a dear sweet Christian woman. She&rsquo;s working
in a settlement. She&rsquo;s privately engaged to the Bishop.
It&rsquo;s not to be published yet. She&rsquo;s a sweet woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get back, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry away, dear. I hoped you would stay and
have some supper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t&rdquo; said Miriam wearily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, perhaps we shall meet again before Thursday.
You&rsquo;ll ask Mrs. Bailey about my box,&rdquo; said Miss Dear getting
to her feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fancy your remembering her name&rdquo; said Miriam with
loud cheerfulness, fumbling with the curtains.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear stood beaming indulgently.
</p>

<p>
All the way down the unlit stone staircase they rallied
<a id="page-263" class="pagenum" title="263"></a>
each other about the country garden with the deck
chairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&rdquo; said Miriam from the street, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know
about Mrs. Bailey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right dear, I shall expect to hear from you; au
revoir&rdquo; cried Miss Dear from the door. In the joy of her
escape into the twilight Miriam waved her hand towards
the indulgently smiling form and flung away, singing.

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar"><span class="prefirstchar">&ldquo;</span>R</span><span class="postfirstchar">egular</span> field-day, eh Miss Hens&rsquo;n? Look
here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Orly turned towards the light
coming in above the front door to exhibit his torn waistcoat
and broken watch-chain. &ldquo;Came for me like a fury.
They&rsquo;ve got double strength y&rsquo;know when they&rsquo;re under.
Ever seen anything like it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam glanced incredulously at the portly frontage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fancy breaking the <em>chain</em>&rdquo; she said, sickened by the
vision of small white desperately fighting hands. He
gathered up the hanging strings of bright links, his powerful
padded musicianly hands finding the edges of the broken
links and holding them adjusted with the discoloured
ravaged fingers of an artizan. &ldquo;A good tug would do it,&rdquo;
he said kindly. &ldquo;A chain&rsquo;s no stronger than the weakest
link&rdquo; he added with a note of dreamy sadness, drawing a
sharp sigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you get the tooth out&rdquo; clutched Miriam automatically
making a mental note of the remark that flashed
through the world with a sad light, a lamp brought into a
hopeless sick-room ... keeping up her attitude of response
to show that she was accepting the apology for the extremities
of rage over the getting of the anæsthetist. Mrs.
Orly appearing in the hall at the moment, still flushed from
the storm, joined the group and outdid Miriam&rsquo;s admiring
amazement, brilliant smiles of relief garlanding her gentle
outcry. &ldquo;Hancock busy?&rdquo; said Mr. Orly in farewell as
he turned and swung away to the den followed by Mrs.
Orly, her unseen face busy with an interrupted errand.
<a id="page-265" class="pagenum" title="265"></a>
He would not hear that her voice was divided.... No
one seemed to be aware of the divided voices ... no men.
Life went on and on, a great oblivious awfulness, sliding
over everything. Every moment things went that could
never be recovered ... on and on, and it was always too
late, there was always some new thing obliterating everything,
something that looked new, but always turned out
to be the same as everything else, grinning with its sameness
in an awful blank where one tried to remember the
killed things ... if only everyone would stop for a moment
and let the thing that was always hovering be there, let it
settle and intensify. But the whole of life was a conspiracy
to prevent it. Was there something wrong in it? It could
not be a coincidence the way life <em>always</em> did that ... she
had reached the little conservatory on the half landing,
darkened with a small forest of aspidistra. The dull dust-laden
leaves identified themselves with her life. What
had become of her autumn of hard work that was to lift
her out of her personal affairs and lead somewhere? Already
the holiday freshness and vigour had left her; and nothing
had been done. Nothing was so strong as the desire that
everything would stop for a moment and allow her to
remember ... wearily she mounted the remaining stairs
to Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;I think&rdquo; said a clear high
confident voice from the chair and stopped. Miriam waited
with painful eagerness while the patient rinsed her mouth;
&ldquo;that that gentleman thinks himself a good deal cleverer
than he is,&rdquo; she resumed sitting back in the chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid I&rsquo;m not as familiar with his work as I ought
to be, but I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve been very greatly impressed as
far as I have gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go any further. There&rsquo;s nothing there to go
for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Who are you speaking of? How do you know? What
have <em>you</em> got that makes you think he has nothing?&mdash;Miriam
almost cried aloud. Could she not see, could not both
of them see that the quiet sheen of the green-painted
<a id="page-266" class="pagenum" title="266"></a>
window-frame cast off their complacent speech? Did they
not hear it tinkle emptily back from the twined leaves and
tendrils, the flowers and butterflies painted on the window
in front of them? The patient had turned briskly to the
spittoon again after her little speech. She would have a
remark ready when the brisk rinsing was over. There could
be no peace in her presence. Even when she was gagged
there would be the sense of her sending out little teasing
thoughts and comments. They could never leave anything
alone ... oh it was <em>that</em> woman ... the little gold
knot at the back of the cheerful little gold head; hair that
curled tightly about her head when she was a baby and that
had grown long and been pinned up, as the clever daughter
of that man; getting to know all he had said about women.
If she believed it she must loathe her married state and her
children ... how <em>could</em> she let life continue through her?
Perhaps it was the sense of her treachery that <em>gave</em> her that
bright brisk amused manner. It was a way of carrying
things off, that maddening way of speaking of everything as
if life were a jest at everybody&rsquo;s expense ... all &ldquo;clever&rdquo;
women seemed to have that, <em>never</em> speaking what they
thought or felt, but always things that sounded like quotations
from men; so that they always seemed to flatter or
criticise the men they were with according as they were as
clever as some man they knew, or less clever. <em>What</em> was
she like when she was alone and dropped that bright <em>manner</em>....
&ldquo;Have you made any New Year resolutions? I don&rsquo;t
make any. My friends think me godless, <em>I</em> think <em>them</em>
lacking in common sense&rdquo; ... exactly like a man; taking
up a fixed attitude ... having a sort of prepared way of
taking everything ... like the Wilsons ... anything else
was &lsquo;unintelligent&rsquo; or &lsquo;absurd&rsquo; ... their impatience
meant something. Somehow all the other people were a
reproach. If some day everyone lived in the clear light of
science, &ldquo;waiting for the pronouncements of science in all
the affairs of life,&rdquo; waiting for the pronouncements of those
sensual dyspeptic men with families who thought of women
<a id="page-267" class="pagenum" title="267"></a>
as existing only to produce more men ... admirably fitted
by Nature&rsquo;s inexorable laws for her biological rôle ...
perhaps she agreed or pretended to think it all a great
lark ... the last vilest flattery ... she had only two
children ... si la femme avait plus de sensibilité elle ne
retomberait pas si facilement dans la grossesse.... La
femme, c&rsquo;est peu galant de le dire, est la femelle de l&rsquo;homme.
The Frenchman at any rate <em>wanted</em> to say something else.
But why want to be gallant ... and why not say man;
it is not very graceful to say it, is the male of woman. If
women had been the recorders of things from the beginning
it would all have been the other way round ... Mary.
Mary, the Jewess, write something about Mary the Jewess;
the Frenchman&rsquo;s Queen of Heaven.
</p>

<p>
Englishmen; the English were &ldquo;the leading race.&rdquo;
&ldquo;England and America together&mdash;the Anglo-Saxon peoples&mdash;could
govern the destinies of the world.&rdquo; <em>What</em> world?
... millions and millions of child-births ... colonial
women would keep it all going ... and religious people
... and if religion went on there would always be all the
people who took the Bible literally ... and if religion
were not true then there was only science. Either way was
equally abominable ... for women.

The far end of the ward was bright sunlight ... there
she was enthroned, commanding the whole length of the
ward, sitting upright, her head and shoulders already conversational,
her hands busy with objects on the bed towards
which her welcoming head was momentarily bent; like a
hostess moving chairs in a small drawing room ... chrysanthemums
all down the ward&mdash;massed on little tables
... a <em>parrot</em> sidling and bobbing along its perch, great big
funny solemn French grey, fresh clean living French grey
pure in the sunlight, a pure canary coloured beak ... clean
grey and yellow ... in the sun ... a curious silent noise
in the stillness of the ward.

&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hear; I wasn&rsquo;t near enough.&rdquo;

<p>
&ldquo;Better late than never, I <em>said</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you <em>know</em> I thought you&rsquo;d only been here a few days
and to-day when I looked at your letter I was simply
<em>astounded</em>. You&rsquo;re sitting up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should hope I am. They kept me on my back, half
starving for three weeks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look very pink and well now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Dr. Ashley Densley said. You ought to
have seen me when I came in. You see I&rsquo;m on chicken
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you feel better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&mdash;you can&rsquo;t really tell how you are till you&rsquo;re up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When are you going to get up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tomorrow I hope dear. So you see you&rsquo;re just in time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean you are going away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They turn you out as soon as you&rsquo;re strong enough to
stand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;<em>how</em> can you get about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dr. Ashley Densley has arranged all that. I&rsquo;m going
to a convalescent home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Oh</em>, that&rsquo;s very nice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Dr. Ashley Densley, he was dreadfully upset.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had some letters to cheer you up.&rdquo; Miriam
spoke impatiently, her eyes rooted on the pale leisurely
hands mechanically adjusting some neatly arranged papers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>No</em> de-er. My friends have all left me to look after
my<em>self</em> this time but since I&rsquo;ve been sitting up, I&rsquo;ve been
trying to get my affairs in order.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought of bringing you some flowers but there was
not a single shop between here and Wimpole Street.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s generally women selling them outside. But
I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ve too much sympathy with the
poor nurses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam glanced fearfully about. There were so many
beds with forms seated and lying upon them ... but there
seemed no illness or pain. Quiet eyes met hers; everything
<a id="page-269" class="pagenum" title="269"></a>
seemed serene; there was no sound but the strange silent
noise of the sunlight and the flowers. Half way down the
ward stood a large three-fold screen covered with dark
American cloth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s unconscious today,&rdquo; said Miss Dear; &ldquo;she won&rsquo;t
last through the night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean to say there is someone <em>dying</em> there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Yes de</em>-er.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean to say they don&rsquo;t put them into a separate
room to <em>die</em>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t dear. They haven&rsquo;t got the <em>space</em>&rdquo; flashed
Miss Dear.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Death shut in with one lonely person. Brisk nurses
putting up the screen. Dying eyes cut off from all but
those three dark surrounding walls, with death waiting
inside them. Miriam&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. There, just
across the room, was the end. It had to come somewhere;
just that; on any summer&rsquo;s afternoon ... people did
things; hands placed a screen, people cleared you away....
It was a relief to realise that there were hospitals to
die in; worry and torture of mind could end here. Perhaps
it might be easier with people all round you than in a little
room. There were hospitals to be ill in and somewhere
to die neatly, however poor you were. It was a relief ...
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s always the last to get up; still snoring when everybody&rsquo;s
fussing and washing.&rdquo; That would be me ... it
lit up the hostel. Miss Dear liked that time of fussing and
washing in company with all the other cubicles fussing and
washing. To be very poor meant getting more and more
social life with no appearances to keep up, getting up each
day with a holiday feeling of one more day and the surprise
of seeing everybody again; and the certainty that if you
died somebody would do something. Certainly it was this
knowledge that gave Miss Dear her peculiar strength. She
was a nurse and knew how everything was done. She knew
that people, all kinds of people were <em>people</em> and would do
<a id="page-270" class="pagenum" title="270"></a>
things. When one was quite alone one could not believe
this. Besides no one <em>would</em> do anything for me. I don&rsquo;t
want anyone to. I should hate the face of a nurse who
put a screen round my bed. I shall not die like that. I shall
die in some other way, out in the sun, with&mdash;yes&mdash;oh yes&mdash;Tah-dee,
t&rsquo;<em>dee</em>, t&rsquo;dee&mdash;t&rsquo;dee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must be funny for a nurse to be in a hospital.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little too funny sometimes dear&mdash;you know too
much about what you&rsquo;re in for.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ilikeyourredjacket. Good <em>Heavens</em>!&rdquo;

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing dear. He does that all the afternoon.&rdquo;

&ldquo;How can you stand it?&rdquo;

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Hobson&rsquo;s choice, madam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The parrot uttered three successive squawks fuller and
harsher and even more shrill than the first.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just tuning up; he always does in the afternoon
just as everybody is trying to get a little sleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I never <em>heard</em> of such a thing! It&rsquo;s monstrous, in
a hospital. Why don&rsquo;t you all complain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Sh dear; he belongs to Matron.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she have him in her room? Shut <em>up</em>,
polly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be rather a roomful in a little room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;what is he <em>here</em>? It&rsquo;s the wickedest thing of
its kind I&rsquo;ve ever heard of; some great fat healthy woman
... why don&rsquo;t the <em>doctors</em> stop it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps they hardly notice it dear. There&rsquo;s such a
bustle going on in the morning when they all come round.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But hang it all she&rsquo;s here to look after you, not to leave
her luggage all over the ward.&rdquo;

The ripe afternoon light ... even outside a hospital
... the strange indistinguishable friend, mighty welcome,
unutterable happiness. Oh death, where is thy sting?
Oh grave, where is thy victory? The light has no end. I

know it and it knows me, no misunderstanding, no barrier.
I love you&mdash;people say things. But nothing that anybody
says has any meaning. Nothing that anybody says has any
meaning. There is something more than anything that
anybody says, that comes, first, before they speak ...
vehicles travelling along through heaven; everybody in
heaven without knowing it; the sound the vehicles made
all together, sounding out through the universe ... life
touches your heart like dew; that is <em>true</em> ... the edge of
his greasy knowing selfish hair touches the light; he brushes
it; there is something in him that remembers. It is in
everybody; but they won&rsquo;t stop. How maddening. But
they know. When people die they must stop. Then they
remember. Remorse may be complete; until it is complete
you cannot live. When it is complete something is burned
away ... ou-agh, flows out of you, burning, inky, acid,
flows right out ... purged ... though thy sins are as
<em>scarlet</em> they shall be white as snow. <em>Then</em> the light is there,
nothing but the light, and new memory, sweet and bright;
but only when you have been killed by remorse.

This is what is meant by a purple twilight. Lamps
alight, small round lights, each in place, shedding no
radiance, white day lingering on the stone pillars of the
great crescent, the park railings distinct, the trees shrouded
but looming very large and permanent, the air wide and
high and purple, darkness alight and warm. Far far away
beyond the length of two endless months is Christmas.
This kind of day lived for ever. It stood still. The whole
year, funny little distant fussy thing stood still in this sort
of day. You could take it in your hand and look at it.
Nobody could touch this. People and books and all those
things that men had done, in the British Museum were a
crackling noise, outside.... Les yeux gris, vont au paradis.
That was the two poplars standing one each side of the little
break in the railings, shooting up; the space between them
shaped by their shapes, leading somewhere. I <em>must</em> have
<a id="page-272" class="pagenum" title="272"></a>
been through there; it&rsquo;s the park. I don&rsquo;t remember.
It isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s waiting. One day I will go through. Les
yeux gris, vont au paradis. Going along, along, the twilight
hides your shabby clothes. They are not shabby. They
are clothes you go along in, funny; jolly. Everything&rsquo;s
here, any bit of anything, clear in your brain; you can look
at it. What a terrific thing a person is; bigger than anything.
How <em>funny</em> it is to be a person. You can never
not have been a person. Bouleversement. It&rsquo;s a fait
bouleversant. <em>Christ</em>-how-rummy. It&rsquo;s enough. <a id="klage"></a>Du,
Heilige, rufe dein Kind zurück, ich habe genossen dass
irdische Glück; ich habe geleibt und gelebet.... Oh let
the solid earth not fail beneath my feet, until I am quite
quite sure.... Hullo, old Euston Road, beloved of my
soul, my own country, my native heath. There&rsquo;ll still be a
glimmer on the table when I light the lamp ... how shall
I write it down, the <em>sound</em> the little boy made as he carefully
carried the milk jug ... going along, trusted, <em>trusted</em>,
you could see it, you could see his mother. His legs came
along, little loose feet, looking after themselves, pottering,
behind him. All his body was in the hand carrying the milk
jug. When he had done carrying the milk jug he would
run; running along the pavement amongst people, with
cool round eyes not looking at anything. Where the crowd
prevented his running he would jog up and down as he
walked, until he could run again, bumping solemnly up and
down amongst the people; boy.

The turning of the key in the latch was lively with the
vision of the jumping boy. The flare of the match in the
unlit hall lit up eternity. The front door was open, eternity
poured in and on up the stairs. At one of those great staircase
windows where the last of the twilight stood a sudden
light of morning would not be surprising. Of course a
letter; curly curious statements on the hall-stand.

That is mother-of-pearl, nacre; twilight nacre; crépuscule
nacre; I must wait until it is gone. It is a visitor;
pearly freshness pouring in; but if I wait I may feel different.
With the blind up the lamp will be a lamp in it; twilight
outside, the lamp on the edge of it, making the room gold,
edged with twilight.

Perhaps it had been Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s that had made
this row of houses generally invisible; perhaps their own
awfulness. When she found herself opposite them, Miriam
recognised them at once. By day they were one high long
lifeless smoke-grimed façade fronted by gardens colourless
with grime, showing at its thickest on the leaves of an
occasional laurel. It had never occurred to her that the
houses could be occupied. She had seen them now and again
as reflectors of the grime of the Metropolitan Railway.
Its smoke poured up over their faces as the smoke from a
kitchen fire pours over the back of a range. The sight of
them brought nothing to her mind but the inside of the
Metropolitan Railway; the feeling of one&rsquo;s skin prickling
with grime the sense of one&rsquo;s smoke-grimed clothes. There
was nothing in that strip between Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s and
the turning into Baker Street but the sense of exposure
to grime ... a little low grimed wall surmounted by
paintless sooty iron railings. On the other side of the road
a high brown wall, protecting whatever was behind, took
<a id="page-274" class="pagenum" title="274"></a>
the grime in one thick covering, here it spread over the
exposed gardens and façades turning her eyes away. To-night
they looked almost as untenanted as she had been
accustomed to think them. Here and there on the black
expanse a window showed a blurred light. The house she
sought appeared to be in total darkness. The iron gate
crumbled harshly against her gloves as she set her weight
against the rusty hinges. Gritty dust sounded under her
feet along the pathway and up the shallow steps leading to
the unlit doorway.

Her flight up through the sickly sweet-smelling murk
of the long staircase ended in a little top back room brilliant
with unglobed gaslight. Miss Dear got her quickly into
the room and stood smiling and waiting for a moment for
her to speak. Miriam stood nonplussed, catching at the
feelings that rushed through her and the thoughts that
spoke in her mind. Distracted by the picture of the calm
tall, gold-topped figure in the long grey skirt and the pale
pink flannel dressing-jacket. Miss Dear was smiling the
smile of one who has a great secret to impart. There was
a saucepan or frying pan or something&mdash;with a handle&mdash;sticking
out.... &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve brought a book&rdquo; said
Miss Dear. The room was closing up and up ... the
door was shut. Miriam&rsquo;s exasperation flew out. She felt
it fly out. What would Miss Dear do or say? &ldquo;I &rsquo;oped
you&rsquo;d come&rdquo; she said in her softest most thoughtful tones.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been rushing about and rushing about.&rdquo; She turned
with her swift limber silent-footed movement to the thing
on the gas-ring. &ldquo;Sit down dear&rdquo; she said, as one giving
permission, and began rustling a paper packet. A haddock
came forth and the slender thoughtful fingers plucked and
picked at it and lifted it gingerly into the shallow steaming
pan. Miriam&rsquo;s thoughts whirled to her room, to the dark
sky-domed streets, to the coming morrow. They flew about
<a id="page-275" class="pagenum" title="275"></a>
all over her life. The cane-seated chair thrilled her with a
fresh sense of anger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been shopping and rushing about&rdquo; said Miss Dear
disengaging a small crusty loaf from its paper bag. Miriam
stared gloomily about and waited.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like haddock, dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yes I think I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fish smelled very savoury. It was wonderful and
astonishing to know how to cook a real meal, in a tiny room;
cheap ... the lovely little loaf and the wholesome solid
fish would cost less than a small egg and roll and butter at
an A.B.C. How did people find out how to do these things?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know how to cook?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haddock doesn&rsquo;t hardly need any cooking&rdquo; said Miss
Dear, shifting the fish about by its tail.

&ldquo;What is your book dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;<em>Villette</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it a pretty book?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She didn&rsquo;t want to know. She was saying something
else.... How to mention it? Why say anything about
it? But no one had ever asked. No one had known.
This woman was the first. She of all people was causing
the first time of speaking of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I bought it when I was fifteen,&rdquo; said Miriam vaguely,
&ldquo;and a Byron&mdash;with some money I had; seven and six.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care for the Byron; but it was a jolly edition;
padded leather with rounded corners and gilt edged leaves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Oh.</em>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reading this thing ever since I came back from
my holidays.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look very big.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam&rsquo;s voice trembled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. When
I&rsquo;ve finished it I begin again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-276" class="pagenum" title="276"></a>
&ldquo;I wish you would read it to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam recoiled. Anything would have done; Donovan
or anything.... But something had sprung into the room.
She gazed at the calm profile, the long slender figure, the
clear grey and pink, the pink frill of the jacket falling back
from the soft fair hair turned cleanly up, the clean fluffy
curve of the skull, the serene line of the brow bent in
abstracted contemplation of the steaming pan. &ldquo;I believe
you&rsquo;d like it&rdquo; she said brightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should love you to read to me when we&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad our
supper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had my supper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bit of haddock won&rsquo;t hurt you dear.... I&rsquo;m afraid
we shall have to be very knockabout; I&rsquo;ve got a knife and
a fork but no plates at present. It comes of living in a <em>box</em>,&rdquo;
said Miss Dear pouring off the steaming water into the slop-pail.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my supper&mdash;really. I&rsquo;ll read while you have
yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t sit out in the middle of the room dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right&rdquo; said Miriam impatiently, finding the
beginning of the first chapter. Her hands clung to the book.
She had not made herself at home as Eve would have done
and talked. Now, those words would sound aloud, in a
room. Someone would hear and see. Miss Dear would not
know what it was. But she would hear and see something.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s by a woman called Charlotte Brontë&rdquo; she said
and began headlong with the gaslight in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
The familiar words sounded chilly and poor. Everything
in the room grew very distinct. Before she had finished the
chapter Miriam knew the position of each piece of furniture.
Miss Dear sat very still. Was she listening patiently like a
mother, or wife, thinking of the reader as well as of what
was read, and with her own thoughts running along independently,
interested now and again in some single thing
in the narrative, something that reminded her of some
<a id="page-277" class="pagenum" title="277"></a>
experience of her own or some person she knew? No,
there was something different. However little she saw
and heard, something was happening. They were looking
and hearing together ... did she feel anything of the
grey ... grey ... grey made up of all the colours there
are; all the colours, seething into an even grey ... she
wondered as she read on almost by heart, at the rare freedom
of her thoughts, ranging about. The book was cold and
unreal compared to what it was when she read it alone.
But something was happening. Something was passing to
and fro between them, behind the text; a conversation
between them that the text, the calm quiet grey that
was the outer layer of the tumult, brought into being. If
they should read on, the conversation would deepen. A
glow ran through her at the thought. She felt that in
some way she was like a man reading to a woman, but the
reading did not separate them like a man&rsquo;s reading did.
She paused for a moment on the thought. A man&rsquo;s reading
was not reading; not a looking and a listening so that things
came into the room. It was always an assertion of himself.
Men read in loud harsh unnatural voices, in sentences, or
with voices that were a commentary on the text, as if they
were telling you what to think ... they preferred reading
to being read to; they read as if they were the authors of
the text. Nothing could get through them but what they
saw. They were like showmen....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on, dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My voice is getting tired. It must be all hours. I
ought to have gone; ages ago,&rdquo; said Miriam settling herself
in the little chair with the book standing opened on the
floor at her side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The time does pass quickly, when it is pleasantly
occupied.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A cigarette now would not be staying on. It would be
like putting on one&rsquo;s hat. Then the visit would be over;
without having taken place. The incident would have
made no break in freedom. They had been both absent
<a id="page-278" class="pagenum" title="278"></a>
from the room nearly all the time. Perhaps that was why
husbands so often took to reading to their wives, when
they stayed at home at all; to avoid being in the room
listening to their condemning silences or to their speech,
speech with all the saucepan and comfort thoughts simmering
behind it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had much time to attend to study. When
you&rsquo;ve got to get your living there&rsquo;s too much else to
do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam glanced sharply. Had she wanted other things
in the years of her strange occupation? She had gone in
for nursing sentimentally and now she knew the other
side; doing everything to time, careful carrying out of the
changing experiments of doctors. Her reputation and living
depended on that; their reputation and living depended
on her. And she had to go on, because it was her living....
Miss Dear was dispensing little gestures with bent
head held high and inturned eyes. She was holding up the
worth and dignity of her career. It had meant sacrifices
that left her mind enslaved. But all the same she thought
excuses were necessary. She resented being illiterate. She
had a brain somewhere, groping and starved. What could
she do? It was too late. What a <em>shame</em> ... serene golden
comeliness, slender feet and hands, strange ability and
knowledge of the world, and she knew, <em>knew</em> there was something
that ought to be hers. Miriam thrilled with pity.
The inturned eyes sent out a challenging blue flash that
expanded to a smile. Miriam recoiled battling in the grip
of the smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come round earlier to-morrow dear, and
have some supper here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How long are you going to stay here?&rdquo; ... to come
again and read further and find that strange concentration
that made one see into things. Did she really like it?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well dear you see I don&rsquo;t know. I must settle up my
affairs a little. I don&rsquo;t know where I am with one thing
and another. I must leave it in the hands of an &rsquo;igher
<a id="page-279" class="pagenum" title="279"></a>
power.&rdquo; She folded her hands and sat motionless with
inturned eyes, making the little movements with her lips
that would lead to further speech, a flashing forth of something....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see&rdquo; said Miriam getting up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be looking for you.&rdquo;

<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> was ... jolly; to have something one was obliged
to do every evening&mdash;but it could not go on. Next
week-end, the Brooms, that would be an excuse for making
a break. She must have other friends she could turn to ...
she must <em>know</em> one could not go on. But bustling off every
evening regularly to the same place with things to get for
somebody was evidently good in some way ... health-giving
and strength-giving....

<p class="tb">

<p class="noindent">
She found Miss Dear in bed; sitting up, more pink
and gold <a id="corr-74"></a>than ever. There was a deep lace frill on the
pink jacket. She smiled deeply, a curious deep smile that
looked like &ldquo;a smile of perfect love and confidence&rdquo; ...
it <em>was</em> partly that. She was grateful, and admiring. That
was all right. But it could not go on; and now illness.
Miriam was aghast. Miss Dear seemed more herself than
ever, sitting up in bed, just as she had been at the
hospital.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not really ill, de-er. I&rsquo;ve had a touch of my epileptiform
neuralgia.&rdquo; Miriam sat staring angrily at the floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to <em>make</em> anyone ill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>What</em> is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sitoowated as I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been able to hear of a case?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I take a case dear when I haven&rsquo;t got my
uniforms?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you sell them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-281" class="pagenum" title="281"></a>
&ldquo;<em>No</em> de-er. They&rsquo;re with all the rest of my things at
the hostel. Just because there&rsquo;s a small balance owing they
refuse to give up my box. I&rsquo;ve told them I&rsquo;ll settle it as
soon as my pecuniary affairs are in order.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see. That was why you didn&rsquo;t send your box on to
me? You know I could pay that off if you like, if it isn&rsquo;t
too much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No dear I couldn&rsquo;t hear of such a thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you <em>must</em> get work, or something. Do your friends
know how things are?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no one I should care to turn to at the
moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the people at the Nursing Association?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear flushed and frowned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of <em>them</em>
dear. I&rsquo;ve told you my opinion of the superintendent and
the nurses are in pretty much the same box as I am. More
than one of them owes me money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But surely if they knew&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t <em>wish</em> to apply to Baker Street at the
present time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you <em>must</em> apply to <em>someone</em>. <em>Something</em> must be
done. You see I can&rsquo;t, I shan&rsquo;t be able to go on indefinitely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear&rsquo;s face broke into weeping. Miriam sat smarting
under her own brutality ... poverty is brutalising, she
reflected miserably, excusing herself. It makes you helpless
and makes sick people fearful and hateful. It ought
not to be like that. One can&rsquo;t even give way to one&rsquo;s
natural feelings. What ought she to have done? To have
spoken gently ... you see dear ... she could hear
women&rsquo;s voices saying it ... my resources are not unlimited,
we must try and think what is the best thing to be done
... humbug ... they would be feeling just as frightened
just as self-protecting, inside. There were people in books
who shouldered things and got into debt, just for any
casual, helpless, person. But it would have to come on
somebody, in the end. What then? Bustling people with
plans ... &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no good sitting still waiting for Providence&rsquo;

... but that was just what one wanted to avoid ... it
had been wonderful, sometimes in the little room. It was
<em>that</em> that had been outraged. It was as if she had struck
a blow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <em>have</em> done something dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent for Dr. Ashley-Densley.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;There is our gentleman,&rdquo; said Miss Dear tranquilly
just before midnight. Miriam moved away and stood by
the window as the door split wide and a tall grey-clad
figure plunged lightly into the room. Miriam missed his
first questions in her observations of his well-controlled
fatigue and annoyance, his astonishing height and slenderness
and the curious <a id="corr-75"></a>wise softness of his voice. Suddenly
she realised that he was going. He was not going to take
anything in hand or do anything. He had got up from the
chair by the bedside and was scribbling something on an
envelope ... no sleep for two nights he said evenly in the
soft musical girlish tones. A prescription ... then he&rsquo;d
be off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know Thomas&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he said colourlessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know Thomas&rsquo;s&mdash;the chemist&mdash;in Baker
Street?&rdquo; he said casting a half-glance in her direction
as he wrote on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Miriam coldly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you be afraid to go round there now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; said Miriam acidly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re not afraid, go to Thomas&rsquo;s, get this
made up, give Miss Dear a dose and if it does not take effect,
another in two hours&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may leave it with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll be off. I&rsquo;ll try to look in sometime
to-morrow,&rdquo; he said turning to Miss Dear. &ldquo;Bye-bye&rdquo;
and he was gone.

<p class="noindent">
When the grey of morning began to show behind the
blind Miriam&rsquo;s thoughts came back to the figure on the
bed. Miss Dear was peacefully asleep lying on her back
with her head thrown back upon the pillow. Her face
looked stonily pure and stern; and colourless in the grey
light. There was a sheen on her forehead like the sheen
on the foreheads of old people. She had probably been
asleep ever since the beginning of the stillness. Everybody
was getting up. &ldquo;London was getting up.&rdquo; That man in
the <em>Referee</em> knew what it was, that feeling when you live
right <em>in</em> London, of being a Londoner, the thing that made
it <em>enough</em> to be a Londoner, getting up, in London; the
thing that made real Londoners different to everyone else,
going about with a sense that made them <em>alive</em>. The very
idea of living anywhere but in London, when one thought
about it, produced a blank sensation in the heart. What
was it I said the other day? &ldquo;London&rsquo;s got me. It&rsquo;s
taking my health and eating up my youth. It may as well
have what remains....&rdquo; Something stirred powerfully,
unable to get to her through her torpid body. Her weary
brain spent its last strength on the words, she had only half
meant them when they were spoken. <em>Now</em>, once she was
free again, to be just a Londoner she would ask nothing
more of life. It would be the answer to all questions;
the perfect unfailing thing, guiding all one&rsquo;s decisions.
And an ill-paid clerkship was its best possible protection;
keeping one at a quiet centre, alone in a little room, untouched
by human relationships, undisturbed by the
necessity of being anything. Nurses and teachers and
doctors and all the people who were doing special things
surrounded by people and talk were not Londoners. Clerks
were, unless they lived in suburbs, the people who lived
in St. Pancras and Bloomsbury and in Seven Dials and all
round Soho and in all the slums and back streets everywhere
<a id="page-284" class="pagenum" title="284"></a>
were. She would be again soon ... not a woman
... a Londoner.
</p>

<p>
She rose from her chair feeling hardly able to stand.
The long endurance in the cold room had led to nothing
but the beginning of a day without strength&mdash;no one
knowing what she had gone through. Three days and
nights of nursing Eve had produced only a feverish gaiety.
It <em>was</em> London that killed you.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will come in at lunch-time&rdquo; she scribbled on the
back of an envelope, and left it near one of the hands
outstretched on the coverlet.
</p>

<p>
Outdoors it was quite light, a soft grey morning, about
eight o&rsquo;clock. People were moving about the streets. The
day would be got through somehow. Tomorrow she would
be herself again.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-31-4">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;Has she applied to the Association to which she
belongs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think she wishes for some reason to keep away from
them just now. She suggested that I should come to you
when I asked her if there was anyone to whom she could
turn. She told me you had helped her to have a holiday
in a convalescent home.&rdquo; These were the right people.
The quiet grey house, the high church room, the delicate
outlines of the woman, clear and fine in spite of all the
comfort.... The All Souls Nursing Sisters.... They
<em>were</em> different ... emotional and unhygienic ... cushions
and hot water bottles ... good food ... early service&mdash;Lent&mdash;stuffy
churches&mdash;fasting. But they would not
pass by on the other side ... she sat waiting ... the
atmosphere of the room made much of her weeks of charity
and her long night of watching, the quiet presence in it
knew of these things without being told. The weariness
of her voice had poured out its burden, meeting and flowing
into the patient weariness of the other women and changing.
There was no longer any anger or impatience. Together,
<a id="page-285" class="pagenum" title="285"></a>
consulting as accomplices, they would see what was the
best thing to do&mdash;whatever it was would be something
done on a long long road going on forever; nobody outside,
nobody left behind. When they had decided they would
leave it, happy and serene and glance at the invisible sun
and make little confident jests together. She was like Mrs.
Bailey&mdash;and someone farther back&mdash;mother. This was the
secret life of women. They smiled at God. But they
all flattered men. All these women....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They ought to be informed. Will you call on them&mdash;to-day?
Or would you prefer that I should do so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will go&mdash;at lunch-time&rdquo; said Miriam promptly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Meanwhile I shall inform the clergy. It is a case for
the parish. You must not bear the responsibility a moment
longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam relaxed in her capacious chair, a dimness before
her eyes. The voice was going on, unnoticing, the figure
had turned towards a bureau. There were little straggles
about the fine hair&mdash;Miss Jenny Perne&mdash;the Pernes. She
was a lonely old maid.... One must listen ... but
London had sprung back ... in full open midday roar;
brilliant and fresh; dim, intimate, vast, from the darkness.
This woman preferred some provincial town ...
Wolverhampton ... Wolverhampton ... in the little room
in Marylebone Road Miss Dear was unconsciously sleeping&mdash;a
pauper.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-31-5">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
There was a large bunch of black grapes on the little
table by the bedside and a book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo you literary female&rdquo; said Miriam seizing it
... Red Pottage ... a curious novelish name, difficult
to understand. Miss Dear sat up, straight and brisk,
blooming smiles. What an easy life. The light changing
in the room and people bringing novels and grapes, smart
new novels that people were reading.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you do at lunch time dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-286" class="pagenum" title="286"></a>
&ldquo;Oh I had to go and see a female unexpectedly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I found your note and thought perhaps you had called
in at Baker Street.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At your Association, d&rsquo;you mean? Oh my dear lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam shook her thoughts about, pushing back. &ldquo;She
owes money to almost every nurse in this house and seems
to have given in in every way&rdquo; and bringing forward
&ldquo;one of our very best nurses for five years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh I went to see the woman in Queen Square this
morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know you did dear.&rdquo; Miss Dear bridled in her secret
way, averted, and preparing to speak. It was over. She
did not seem to mind. &ldquo;I liked her&rdquo; said Miriam hastily,
leaping across the gap, longing to know what had been done,
beating out anywhere to rid her face of the lines of shame.
She was sitting before a judge ... being looked through
and through.... Noo, Tonalt, suggest a tow-pic....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a sweet woman&rdquo; said Miss Dear patronisingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s brought you some nice things&rdquo; ... poverty
was worse if you were not poor enough....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no dear. The curate brought these. He called
twice this morning. You did me a good turn. He&rsquo;s a real
friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m so glad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;he&rsquo;s a nice little man. He was most dreadfully
upset.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can he do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well in general?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to do everything dear. I&rsquo;m not to worry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He came in first thing and saw how things stood and
came in again at the end of the morning with these things.
He&rsquo;s sending me some wine, from his own cellar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam gazed, her thoughts tumbling incoherently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was most dreadfully upset. He could not write
his sermon. He kept thinking it might be one of his own
<a id="page-287" class="pagenum" title="287"></a>
<em>sisters</em> in the same sitawation. He couldn&rsquo;t rest till he came
back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Standing back ... all the time ... delicately preparing
to speak ... presiding over them all ... over herself too....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you looked at the book?&rdquo; There was nothing
more to do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No dear. He said it had interested him very much.
He reads them for his sermons you see&rdquo; ... she put out
her hand and touched the volume ... John&rsquo;s books ...
Henry is so interested in photography ... unknowing
patronising respectful gestures.... &ldquo;Poor little man.
He was dreadfully upset.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better read it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What time are you coming dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to have my meals regular. Mr. Taunton has seen
the landlady. I wish I could ask you to join me. But he&rsquo;s
been so generous. I mustn&rsquo;t run expenses up you see dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ll come in after supper. I&rsquo;m not
quite sure about to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;I hope I shall see you on Saturday. I can give
you tea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away for the week-end. I&rsquo;ve put it off and
off. I must go this week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear frowned. &ldquo;Well dear, come in and see me
on your way.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-31-6">

<p class="noindent">
Miss Dear sat down with an indrawn breath.
</p>

<p>
Miriam drew her Gladstone bag a little closer. &ldquo;I have
only a second.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All <em>right</em> dear. You&rsquo;ve only just come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was as if nothing had happened the whole week. She
was not going to say anything. She was ill again just in time
for the week-end. She looked fearfully ill. Was she ill?
The room was horrible&mdash;desolate and angry....
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-288" class="pagenum" title="288"></a>
Miriam sat listening to the indrawn breathings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my epileptiform neuralgia again. I thought Dr.
Ashley-Densley would have been in. I suppose he&rsquo;s off for
the week-end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She lay back pale and lifeless looking with her eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t go, that&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; said Miriam
angrily.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-31-7">

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;Have another cup dear. He said the picture was like
me and like my name. He thinks it&rsquo;s the right name for
me&mdash;&lsquo;you&rsquo;ll always be able to inspire affection&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wants me to change my first name. He thought
Eleanor would be pretty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <em>say</em>; look here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I can&rsquo;t make any decision until I know
certain things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say ... <em>good</em>ness!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear chuckled indulgently, making little brisk
movements about the tea-tray.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m to be called Eleanor Dear. He&rsquo;s a dear little
man. I&rsquo;m very fond of him. But there is an earlier
friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d help me out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>I?</em>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well dear, I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t mind calling and
finding out for me how the land lies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam&rsquo;s eyes fixed the inexorable shapely outlines of the
tall figure. That dignity would never go; but there was
something, that would never come ... there would be
nothing but fuss and mystification for the man. She would
have a house and a dignified life. He, at home, would have
death. But these were the women. But she had liked the
book. There was something in it she had felt. But a man
<a id="page-289" class="pagenum" title="289"></a>
reading, seeing only bits and points of view would never
find that far-away something. She would hold the man by
being everlastingly mysteriously up to something or other
behind a smile. He would grow sick to death of mysterious
nothings; of things always centering in her, leaving everything
else outside her dignity. Appalling. What <em>was</em>
she doing all the time, bringing one&rsquo;s eyes back and back
each time after one had angrily given in, to question the
ruffles of her hair and the way she stood and walked and
prepared to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh...! of <em>course</em> I will&mdash;you wicked woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very puzzling. You see he&rsquo;s the earlier friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think if he knew he had a rival. Of course. Quite
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well dear, I think he ought to <em>know</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m to be your mamma. What a <em>lark</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Dear shed a fond look. &ldquo;I want you to meet my
little man. He&rsquo;s longing to meet you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you mentioned me to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well dear who should I mention if not you?&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-31-8">
8
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;So I thought the best thing to do would be to come
and ask you what would be the best thing to do for her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be done for her.&rdquo; He turned away
and moved things about on the mantelpiece. Miriam&rsquo;s
heart beat rebelliously in the silence of the consulting-room.
She sat waiting stifled with apprehension, her thoughts on
Miss Dear&rsquo;s familiar mysterious figure. In an unendurable
impatience she waited for more, her eye smiting the tall
averted figure on the hearthrug, following his movements
... small framed coloured pictures&mdash;very brilliant&mdash;photographs?&mdash;of
dark and fair women, all the same, their
shoulders draped like the Soul&rsquo;s Awakening, their chests
bare, all of them with horrible masses of combed out
waving hair like the woman in the Harlene shop only waving
<a id="page-290" class="pagenum" title="290"></a>
naturally. The most awful minxes ... his ideals. What
a man. What a ghastly world. &ldquo;If she were to go to the
south of France, at once, she might live for years&rdquo; ...
this is hearing about death, in a consulting-room ... no
escape ... everything in the room holding you in. The
Death Sentence.... People would not die if they did not
go to consulting-rooms ... doctors make you die ...
they watch and threaten.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter with her?&rdquo; Out with it, don&rsquo;t
be so important and mysterious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, my dear girl?&rdquo; Dr. Densley wheeled
round with searching observant eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she told you?&rdquo; he added quietly with his eyes
on his nails. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s phthisical. She&rsquo;s in the first stages
of pulmonary tuberculosis.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The things in the dark room darkled with a curious dull
flash along all their edges and settled in a stifling dusky
gloom. Everything in the room dingy and dirty and
decaying, but the long lean upright figure. In time he
would die of something. Phthisis ... that curious terrible
damp mouldering smell, damp warm faint human fungus
... in Aunt Henderson&rsquo;s bedroom.... But she had got
better.... But the curate ought to know. But perhaps
he too, perhaps she had <em>imagined</em> that....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems strange she has not told such an old friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an old friend. I&rsquo;ve only known her about two
months. I&rsquo;m hardly a friend at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Densley was roaming about the room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been
a friend in need to that poor girl&rdquo; he murmured contemplating
the window curtains. &ldquo;I recognised that when
I saw you in her room last week.&rdquo; How superficial....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where did you meet her?&rdquo; he said, a curious gentle
high tone on the where and a low one on the meet as if
he were questioning a very delicate patient.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My sister picked her up at a convalescent home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned very sharply and came and sat down in a low
chair opposite Miriam&rsquo;s low chair.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-291" class="pagenum" title="291"></a>
&ldquo;Tell me all about it my dear girl&rdquo; he said sitting
forward so that his clasped hands almost touched Miriam&rsquo;s
knees.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-31-9">
9
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;And she told you I was her oldest friend,&rdquo; he said,
getting up and going back to the mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I first met Miss Dear&rdquo; he resumed after a pause,
speaking like a witness &ldquo;last Christmas. I called in at Baker
Street and found the superintendent had four of her disengaged
nurses down with influenza. At her request I ran
up to see them. Miss Dear was one of the number. Since
that date she has summoned me at all hours on any and every
pretext. What I can, I have done for her. She knows
perfectly well her condition. She has her back against the
wall. She&rsquo;s making a splendid fight. But the one thing
that would give her a chance she obstinately refuses to do.
Last summer I found for her employment in a nursing
home in the South of France. She refused to go, though
I told her plainly what would be the result of another
winter in England.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ought she to marry?&rdquo; said Miriam suddenly, closely
watching him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is she thinking of marrying, my dear girl&rdquo; he answered,
looking at his nails.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well of course she <em>might</em>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there a sweetheart on the horizon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well she inspires a great deal of affection. I think
she is inspiring affection <em>now</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Densley threw back his head with a laugh that caught
his breath and gasped in and out on a high tone, leaving
his silent mouth wide open when he again faced Miriam
with the laughter still in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me my dear girl&rdquo; he said smiting her knee with
gentle affection, &ldquo;is there someone who would like to
marry her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I want to <em>know</em>&rdquo; said Miriam very briskly &ldquo;is
<a id="page-292" class="pagenum" title="292"></a>
whether such a person ought to know about the state of
her health.&rdquo; She found herself cold and trembling as she
asked. Miss Dear&rsquo;s eyes seemed fixed upon her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The chance of a tuberculous woman in marriage&rdquo;
recited Dr. Densley &ldquo;is a holding up of the disease with
the first child; after the second she usually fails.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Why children? A doctor could see nothing in marriage
but children. This man saw women with a sort of admiring
pity. He probably estimated all those women on the mantelpiece
according to their child-bearing capacity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Personally, I do not believe in forbidding the marriage
of consumptives; provided both parties know what they
are doing; and if they are quite sure they cannot do without
each other. We know so little about heredity and disease,
we do not know always what life is about. Personally
I would not divide two people who are thoroughly devoted
to each other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&rdquo; said Miriam coldly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is the young man in a position to take her abroad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you more than I know&rdquo; said Miriam
impatiently getting up.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Densley laughed again and rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you came my dear girl. Come again
soon and report progress. You&rsquo;re so near you can run in
any time when you&rsquo;re free.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; said Miriam politely, scrutinising him
calmly as he waved and patted her out into the hall.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-31-10">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Impelled by an uncontrollable urgency she made her
way along the Marylebone Road. Miss Dear was not
expecting her till late. But the responsibility, the urgency.
She must go abroad. About Dr. Densley. That was easy
enough. There was a phrase ready about that somewhere.
Three things. But she could not go abroad to-night. Why
not go to the Lyons at Portland Road station and have a
<a id="page-293" class="pagenum" title="293"></a>
meal and get calm and think out a plan? But there was no
time to lose. There was not a moment to lose. She arrived
at the dark gate breathless and incoherent. A man was
opening the gate from the inside. He stood short and
compact in the gloom holding it open for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it Miss Henderson?&rdquo; he said nervously as she passed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Miriam stopping dead, flooded with sadness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have been hoping to see you for the last ten days&rdquo;
he said hurriedly and as if afraid of being overheard. In
the impenetrable gloom darker than the darkness his voice
was a thread of comfort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Could you come and see me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you will give me your number in Wimpole Street
I will send you a note.&rdquo;

&ldquo;My <em>dear</em>!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tall figure, radiant, lit from head to foot, &ldquo;as the
light on a falling wave&rdquo; ... &ldquo;as the light on a falling
wave.&rdquo; ...
</p>

<p>
Everything stood still as they gazed at each other. Her
own self gazed at her out of Miss Dear&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m <em>bothered</em>&rdquo; said Miriam at last, sinking into a
chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No need to be bothered any more dear&rdquo; laughed Miss
Dear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s extraordinary.&rdquo; She tried to recover the glory
of the first moment in speechless contemplation of the
radiant figure now moving chairs near to the lamp. The
disappearance of the gas, the shaded lamp, the rector&rsquo;s
wife&rsquo;s manner, the rector&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s quiet stylish costume;
it was like a prepared scene. How funny it would be to
know a rector&rsquo;s wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s longing to meet you. I shall have a second room
to-morrow. We will have a tea party.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-294" class="pagenum" title="294"></a>
&ldquo;It was to-day, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just before you came&rdquo; said Miss Dear her glowing
face bent, her hands brushing at the new costume. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be our greatest friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how grand you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He made my future his care some days ago dear. As
long as I live you shall want for nothing he said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And to-day it all came out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;ll have to get a <em>living</em> dear. But we&rsquo;ve
decided to ignore the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What did she mean by that....
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well dear I mean let the world go by.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see. He&rsquo;s a jewel. I think you&rsquo;ve made a very good
choice. You can make your mind easy about that. I saw
the great medicine man to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was all settled without that dear. I never even
thought about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t. No woman need. He&rsquo;s a man who
doesn&rsquo;t know his own mind and never will. I doubt very
much whether he has a mind to know. If he ever marries
he will marry a <em>wife</em>, not any particular woman; a smart
worldly woman for his profession, or a thoroughly healthy
female who&rsquo;ll keep a home in the country for him and
have children and pour out his tea and grow things in the
garden, while he flirts with patients in town. He&rsquo;s most
awfully susceptible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect we shan&rsquo;t live in London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;ll be better for you won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean de-er?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well. I ought to tell you Dr. Densley told me you
ought to go abroad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for me to go abroad dear, I shall be
all right if I can look <em>after</em> myself and get into the air.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect you will. Everything&rsquo;s happened just right
hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all been in the hands of an &rsquo;igher power, dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-295" class="pagenum" title="295"></a>
Miriam found herself chafing again. It had all rushed
on, in a few minutes. It was out of her hands completely
now. She did not want to know Mr. and Mrs. Taunton.
There was nothing to hold her any longer. She had seen
Miss Dear in the new part. To watch the working out of
it, to hear about the parish, sudden details about people
she did not know&mdash;intolerable.

<p class="noindent first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> short figure looked taller in the cassock, funny
and hounded, like all curates; pounding about and
arranging a place for her and trying to collect his thoughts
while he repeated how good it was of her to have come.
He sat down at last to the poached eggs and tea laid on one
end of the small book-crowded table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a service at four-thirty&rdquo; he said busily eating
and glaring in front of him with unseeing eyes, a little
like Mr. Grove only less desperate because his dark head
was round and his eyes were blue&mdash;&ldquo;so you must excuse
my meal. I have a volume of <em>Plato</em> here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes&rdquo; said Miriam doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you familiar with Plato?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pondered intensely and rushed in just in time to
prevent his speaking again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <em>should</em> like him I know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve come across extracts in
other books.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a great man; my favourite companion. I spend
most of my leisure up here with Plato.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a delightful life&rdquo; said Miriam enviously, looking
about the small crowded room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As much time as I can spare from my work at the
Institute and the Mission chapel; they fill my <em>active</em>
hours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Where would a woman, a wife-woman, be in a life like
this? He poured himself out a cup of tea; the eyes turned
towards the tea-pot were worried and hurried; his whole
compact rounded form was a little worried and anxious.
<a id="page-297" class="pagenum" title="297"></a>
There was something&mdash;bunnyish about him. Reading
Plato the expression of his person would still have something
of the worried rabbit about it. His face would be
calm and intent. Then he would look up from the page,
taking in a thought and something in his room would bring
him back again to worry. But he was too stout to belong
to a religious order.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must have a very busy life&rdquo; said Miriam, her
attention wandering rapidly off hither and thither.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course&rdquo; he said turning away from the table to the
fire beside which she sat. &ldquo;I think the clergy should keep
in touch to some extent with modern thought&mdash;in so far
as it helps them with their own particular work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam wondered why she felt no desire to open the
subject of religion and science; or any other subject. It
was so extraordinary to find herself sitting tête-à-tête with
a clergyman, and still more strange to find him communicatively
trying to show her his life from the inside. He went
on talking, not looking at her but gazing into the fire. She
tried in vain to tether her attention. It was straining away
to work upon something, upon some curious evidence it
had collected since she came into the room; and even
with her eyes fixed upon his person and her mind noting
the strange contradiction between the thin rippling many-buttoned
cassock and the stout square-toed boots protruding
beneath it, she could not completely convince herself
that he was there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;... novels; my friends to recommend any that
might be helpful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had looked up towards her with this phrase.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, Red Pottage&rdquo; she said grasping hurriedly and
looking attentive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you read that novel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I imagined that you had because you lent it to
Miss Dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Dear has spoken to you of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-298" class="pagenum" title="298"></a>
&ldquo;Of you she has spoken a great deal. You know her very
well. It is because of your long friendship with her that
I have taken courage to ask you to come here and discuss
with me about her affairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have known Miss Dear only a very short time&rdquo; said
Miriam, sternly gazing into the fire. Nothing should
persuade her to become the caretaker of the future Mrs.
Taunton.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That surprises me very much indeed&rdquo; he said propping
his head upon his hand by one finger held against a tooth.
He sat brooding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is very much in need of friends just now&rdquo; he said
suddenly and evenly towards the fire without removing
his finger from his tooth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Miriam gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are, nevertheless, the only intimate woman friend
to whom just now she has access.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done little things for her. I couldn&rsquo;t do much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were sorry for her.&rdquo; Mr. Taunton was studying
her face and waiting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;she&rdquo; she consulted the fire
intensely, looking for the truth; &ldquo;she seems to me too
strong for that.&rdquo; Light! Women have no pity on women
... they <em>know</em> how <em>strong</em> women are; a sick man <em>is</em> more
helpless and pitiful than a sick woman; almost as helpless
as a child. People in order of strength ... women, men,
children. This man without his worldly props, his money
and his job and his health had not a hundredth part of the
strength of a woman ... nor had Dr. Densley....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think she <em>fascinated</em> me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Taunton gathered himself together in his chair
and sat very upright.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has an exceptional power of inspiring affection&mdash;affection
and the desire to give her the help she so sorely
needs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps that is it&rdquo; said Miriam judicially. But you
are very much mistaken in calling on me for help ...
<a id="page-299" class="pagenum" title="299"></a>
&lsquo;domestic work and the care of the aged and the sick&rsquo;&mdash;very
convenient&mdash;all the stuffy nerve-racking never-ending
things to be dumped on to women&mdash;who are to be openly
praised and secretly despised for their unselfishness&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
got twice the brain power you have. You are something
of a scholar; but there is a way in which my time is more
valuable than yours. There is a way in which it is more
right for you to be tied to this woman than for me. Your
reading is a habit, like most men&rsquo;s reading, not a quest.
You don&rsquo;t want it disturbed. But you are kinder than I
am. You are splendid. It will be awful&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know
how awful yet&mdash;poor little man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it has been so in my case if you will allow me to
tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes <em>do</em>&rdquo; said Miriam a little archly&mdash;&ldquo;of course&mdash;I
know&mdash;I mean to say Miss Dear has told me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; he said eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How things are&rdquo; she finished looking shyly into the fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nevertheless if you will allow me I should like to tell
you exactly what has occurred and to ask your advice as
to the future. My mother and sisters are in the Midlands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Miriam in a carefully sombre non-committal
tone; waiting for the revelation of some of the things men
expect from mothers and sisters and wondering whether
he was beginning to see her unsuitability for the rôle of
convenient sister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When my rector sent me to look up Miss Dear&rdquo; he
began heavily &ldquo;I thought it was an ordinary parish case
and I was shocked beyond measure to find a delicately
nurtured ladylike girl in such a situation. I came back
here to my rooms and found myself unable to enter into
my usual employments. I was haunted by the thought
of what that lonely girl who might have been one of my
own sisters&mdash;must be suffering and enduring and I returned
to give what relief I could without waiting to report the
case to my rector for ordinary parish relief. I am not
dependent on my stipend and I felt that I could not withhold
<a id="page-300" class="pagenum" title="300"></a>
the help she ought to have. I saw her landlady and
made arrangements as to her feeding and called each day
myself to take little things to cheer her&mdash;as a rule when
my day&rsquo;s work was done. I have never come in contact
with a more pathetic case. It did not occur to me for
... a moment that she viewed my visits and the help I
was so glad to be able to give ... in ... in any other
light ... that she viewed me as other than her parish
priest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of <em>course</em> not&rdquo; said Miriam violently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is a singularly attractive and lovable nature. That
to my mind makes her helplessness and resourcelessness all
the more painfully pathetic. Her very name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
paused gazing into the fire. &ldquo;I told her lately in one of
her moments of deep depression that she would never
want for friends, that she would always inspire affection
wherever she went and that as long as I lived she should
never know want. Last week&mdash;the day I met you at the
gates&mdash;finding her up and apparently very much better, I
suggested that it would be well to discontinue my visits
for the present, pointing out the social reasons and so
forth.... I had with me a letter from a very pleasant
Home in Bournemouth. She had hinted much earlier
that a long rest in some place such as Bournemouth was
what she wanted to set her up in health. I am bound to
tell you what followed. She broke down completely, told
me that, socially speaking, it was too late to discontinue
my visits; that people in the house were already talking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;People in <em>that</em> house!&rdquo;&mdash;you little simpleton&mdash;&ldquo;Who?
It is the most monstrous thing I ever heard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;there you have the whole story. The poor girl&rsquo;s
distress and dependence were most moving. I have a very
great respect for her character and esteem for her personality&mdash;and
of course I am pledged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Miriam narrowly regarding him. Do you
want to be saved&mdash;ought I to save you&mdash;why should I save
you&mdash;it is a solution of the whole thing and a use for your
<a id="page-301" class="pagenum" title="301"></a>
money&mdash;you won&rsquo;t marry her when you know how ill
she is.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is of course the immediate future that causes me
anxiety and disquietude. It is there I need your advice and
help.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see. Is Miss Dear going to Bournemouth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well; that is just it. Now that the opportunity is
there she seems disinclined to avail herself of it. I hope
that you will support me in trying to persuade her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course. She <em>must</em> go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad you think so. It is obvious that definite plans
must be postponed until she is well and strong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would be able to go down and see her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Occasionally, as my duties permit, oh yes. It is a very
pleasant place and I have friends in Bournemouth who
would visit her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She ought to be longing to go&rdquo; said Miriam on her
strange sudden smile. It had come from somewhere; the
atmosphere was easier; suddenly in the room with her
was the sense of bluebells, a wood blue with bluebells, and
dim roofs, roofs in a town ... sur les toits ... and
books; people reading books under them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Taunton smiled too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Unfortunately that is not so&rdquo; he said leaning back in
his chair and crossing his legs comfortably.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-32-2">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;You know&rdquo; he said turning his blue gaze from the fire
to Miriam&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;I have never been so worried in my life
as I have during the last ten days. It&rsquo;s upsetting my winter&rsquo;s
work. It is altogether too difficult and impossible. I cannot
see any possible adjustment. You see I cannot possibly
be continually interrupted and in such&mdash;strange ways. She
came here yesterday afternoon with a list of complaints
about her landlady. I <em>really</em> cannot attend to these things.
She sends me <em>telegrams</em>. Only this morning there was a
<a id="page-302" class="pagenum" title="302"></a>
telegram. Come at once. Difficulty with chemist. Of
course it was impossible for me to leave my work at a
moment&rsquo;s notice. This afternoon I called. It seems that
she was under the impression that there had been some
insolence ... it absorbs so much <em>time</em> to enter into long
explanations with regard to all these people. I cannot do
it. That is what it comes to. I cannot do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<em>Ah.</em> You&rsquo;ve lost your temper; like anyone else. You want
to shelve it. Anyone would. But being a man you want
to shelve it on to a woman. You don&rsquo;t care who hears the
long tales as long as you don&rsquo;t....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you seen her doctor?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I think just now he is out of town.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Really?</em> Are you sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think I should see him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will do so on the first opportunity. That is the next
step. Meantime I will write provisionally to Bournemouth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she must go to Bournemouth anyhow; that&rsquo;s
settled.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps her medical man may help there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t make her do anything she doesn&rsquo;t mean to
do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see you are a reader of character.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am. I always begin by idealising people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you indeed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, always; and then they grow smaller and smaller.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that your invariable experience of humanity?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m an altruist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think one must have one&rsquo;s heroes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In life or in books?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In both perhaps&mdash;one has them certainly in books&mdash;in
records. Do you know this book?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam sceptically accepted the bulky volume he took
down from the book-crowded mantelshelf.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh how interesting&rdquo; she said insincerely when she had
read Great Thoughts from Great Lives on the cover....
<a id="page-303" class="pagenum" title="303"></a>
I ought to have said I don&rsquo;t like extracts. &ldquo;Lives of great
men all remind us. We can make our lives sublime,&rdquo; she
read aloud under her breath from the first page.... I
ought to go. I can&rsquo;t enter into this.... I hate &lsquo;great
men&rsquo; I think....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That book has been a treasure-house to me&mdash;for many
years. I know it now almost by heart. If it interests you,
you will allow me I hope to present it to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh you must not let me deprive you of it&mdash;oh <em>no</em>. It
is very kind of you; but you really mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She looked
up and returned quickly to the fascinating pages. Sentences
shone out striking at her heart and brain ... names in
italics; Marcus Aurelius ... Lao-Tse. Confucius ...
Clement of Alexandria ... Jacob Boehme. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s full of
the most fascinating things. Oh no; I couldn&rsquo;t think of
taking it. You must keep it. Who is Jacob Boehme?
That name always <em>fascinates</em> me. I must have read something,
somewhere, a long time ago. I can&rsquo;t remember.
But it is such a <em>wonderful</em> name.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jacob Boehme was a German visionary. You will find
of course all shades of opinion there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All contradicting each other; that&rsquo;s the worst of it.
Still, I suppose all roads lead to Rome.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see you have thought a great deal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&rdquo; said Miriam feverishly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s always <em>science</em>,
always all that awful business of science, and no getting rid
of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think&mdash;in that matter&mdash;one must not allow one&rsquo;s
mind to be led away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But one must keep an <em>open</em> mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you familiar with Professor Tyndall?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only by meeting him in books about Huxley.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;he was very different; very different.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Huxley&rdquo; said Miriam with intense bitterness &ldquo;was an
egoistic <em>adolescent</em>&mdash;all his life. I <em>never</em> came across <em>anything</em>
like his conceited complacency in my life. The very look
of his side-whiskers,&mdash;well, there you have the whole man.&rdquo;
<a id="page-304" class="pagenum" title="304"></a>
Her heart burned and ached, beating out the words. She
rose to go holding the volume in hands that shook to the
beating of her heart. Far away in the bitter mist of the
darkening room was the strange little figure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me just write your name in the book.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, really, it is too bad&mdash;thank you very much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He carried the book to the window-sill and stood writing
his bent head very dark and round in the feeble grey
light. Happy monk alone up under the roof with his
Plato. It was a <em>shame</em>.

</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a big room. Come in young lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miriam crossed to the fireplace through a warm faintly
sweet atmosphere. A small fire was smoking and the gas
was partly turned down but the room was warm with a
friendly brown warmth. Something had made her linger
in the hall until Mrs. Bailey had come to the dining-room
door and stood there with the door wide open and something
to communicate waiting behind her friendly greetings.
As a rule there was nothing behind her friendly greetings
but friendly approval and assurance. Miriam had never
seen the dining-room door open before and sought distraction
from the communicativeness by drifting towards
it and peering in. Once in and sitting in the chair between
the fireplace and Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s tumbled work-basket standing
on the edge of the long table, bound to stay taking
in the room until Mrs. Bailey returned, she regretted
looking in. The hall and the stairs and her own room
would be changed now she knew what this room was like.
In her fatigue she looked about half taking in half recoiling
from the contents of the room. &ldquo;He stopped and got off

me.&rdquo; Already he knew that they were tiresome strangers
to each other. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go dancing off to Bournemouth
at a moment&rsquo;s notice dear.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I strongly advise you
to go as soon as you can.&rdquo; &ldquo;Of <em>course</em> I&rsquo;m going, but I
can&rsquo;t just dance off.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him get into the habit
of associating you with the idea of worry.&rdquo; If she didn&rsquo;t
<a id="page-306" class="pagenum" title="306"></a>
<em>worry</em> him and was always a little ill, and pretty ... &ldquo;he
says he can&rsquo;t do without her. I&rsquo;ve told him without reserve
what the chances are and given them my blessing.&rdquo; Did
he really feel that suddenly sitting there in the consulting-room?
If only she wouldn&rsquo;t be so mysterious and
important about nothing....
</p>

<p>
There was a hugeness in the room, radiating from the
three-armed dim-globed chandelier, going up and up; to
the high heavily-moulded smoke-grimed ceiling, spreading
out right and left along the length of the room, a large
enclosed quietness, flowing up to the two great windows,
hovering up and down the dingy rep and dingy lace curtains
and the drab coloured venetian blinds through whose chinks
the street came in. Tansley Street was there, pressing its
secret peace against the closed windows. Between the
windows a long strip of mirror framed in tarnished gilt,
reflected the peace of the room. Miriam glanced about
peering for its secret; her eye running over the length of
the faded patterned deep fringed table cover, the large
cracked pink bowl in the centre, holding an aspidistra ...
brown cracked leaves sticking out; the faded upholstery
of the armchair opposite her, the rows of dining-room
chairs across the way in line with the horsehair sofa; the
piano in the space between the sofa and the window;
the huge mirror in the battered tarnished gilt frame sweeping
half way up the wall above the mantelpiece, reflecting
the pictures and engravings hung rather high on the opposite
wall, bought and liked long ago, the faded hearthrug under
her feet, the more faded carpet disappearing under the long
table, the dark stare of the fireplace, the heavy marble
mantelpiece, the marble cased clock and opaque pink glass
fat-bodied jugs scrolled with a dingy pattern, dusty lustres,
curious objects in dull metal....

<p>
Miriam tried to see Mrs. Bailey presiding, the huge table
lined with guests. She doubted. Those boarding-houses
in Woburn Place, the open windows in the summer, the
strange smart people, in evening dress, the shaded lamps,
she would be lost. She could never hold her own. The
quiet house would be utterly changed. There would be
people going about, in possession, all over the front steps
and at the dining-room windows and along the drawing-room
balcony.

</p>

<p class="src">
Extracts from an article published in &ldquo;The Egoist,&rdquo; April, 1918.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
... By imposing very strict limitations on herself she has
brought her art, her method, to a high pitch of perfection, so that
her form seems to be newer than it perhaps is. She herself is unaware
of the perfection of her method. She would probably deny
that she has written with any deliberate method at all. She
would say: &ldquo;I only know there are certain things I mustn&rsquo;t do
if I was to do what I wanted.&rdquo; Obviously, she must not interfere;
she must not analyse or comment or explain. Rather less obviously,
she must not tell a story or handle a situation or set a scene; she
must avoid drama as she avoids narration. And there are some
things she must not be. She must not be the wise, all-knowing
author. She must be Miriam Henderson. She must not know or
divine anything that Miriam does not know or divine; she must
not see anything that Miriam does not see. She has taken Miriam&rsquo;s
nature upon her. She is not concerned, in the way that other
novelists are concerned, with character. Of the persons who move
through Miriam&rsquo;s world you know nothing but what Miriam
knows. If Miriam is mistaken, well, she and not Miss Richardson
is mistaken. Miriam is an acute observer, but she is very far from
seeing the whole of these people. They are presented to us in the
same vivid but fragmentary way in which they appeared to Miriam,
the fragmentary way in which people appear to most of us. Miss
Richardson has only imposed on herself the conditions that life
imposes on us all. And if you are going to quarrel with those
conditions you will not find her novels satisfactory. But your
satisfaction is not her concern.
</p>

<p>
And I find it impossible to reduce to intelligible terms this
satisfaction that I feel. To me these three novels show an art and
method and form carried to punctilious perfection. Yet I have
heard other novelists say that they have no art and no method and
no form, and that it is this formlessness that annoys them. They
say that they have no beginning and no middle and no end, and
that to have form a novel most have an end and a beginning and a
middle. We have come to words that in more primitive times
would have been blows on this subject. There is a certain plausibility
in what they say, but it depends on what constitutes a
beginning and a middle and an end. In this series there is no
drama, no situation, no set scene. Nothing happens. It is just
life going on and on. It is Miriam Henderson&rsquo;s stream of consciousness
going on and on. And in neither is there any grossly discernible
beginning or middle or end.
</p>

<p>
In identifying herself with this life, which is Miriam&rsquo;s stream
of consciousness, Miss Richardson produces her effect of being the
first, of getting closer to reality than any of our novelists who are
trying so desperately to get close. No attitude or gesture of her
own is allowed to come between her and her effect. Whatever her
sources and her raw material, she is concerned and we ought to be
concerned solely with the finished result, the work of art. It is to
Miriam&rsquo;s almost painfully acute senses that we owe what in any
other novelist would be called the &ldquo;portraits&rdquo; of Miriam&rsquo;s
mother, of her sister Harriett, of the Corries and Joey Banks in
<em>Honeycomb</em>, of the Miss Pernes and Julia Doyle, and the North
London schoolgirls, in <em>Backwater</em>, of Fräulein Pfaff and Mademoiselle,
of the Martins and Emma Bergmann and Ulrica and
&ldquo;the Australian&rdquo; in <em>Pointed Roofs</em>. The mere &ldquo;word-painting&rdquo;
is masterly....
</p>

<p>
It is as if no other writers had ever used their senses so purely
and with so intense a joy in their use.
</p>

<p>
This intensity is the effect of an extreme concentration on the
thing seen or felt. Miss Richardson disdains every stroke that
does not tell. Her novels are novels of an extraordinary compression,
and of an extenuation more extraordinary still. The moments
of Miriam&rsquo;s consciousness pass one by one, or overlapping;
moments tense with vibration, moments drawn out fine, almost to
snapping-point.
</p>

<p class="transnote">
Transcriber&rsquo;s Notes
</p>

<p>
The original spelling and punctuation were mostly preserved. In &ldquo;The Tunnel&rdquo;,
Dorothy Richardson experimented with punctuation, in particular leaving out many
commas, in order to promote &ldquo;creative collaboration&rdquo; with the reader.
Therefore, punctuation was mostly left unchanged, as was the varying usage of hyphens.
</p>

<p>
In a few cases, perhaps to mark Madame Szigmondy&rsquo;s pronounciation, &ldquo;r&rdquo; has been
substituted by &ldquo;g&rdquo; (&ldquo;<a href="#pgonounce">pgonounce</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="#thegese">Thégèse</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="#rgun">rgun</a>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<a href="#cgeature">cgeature</a>&rdquo;). This seems to be intentional and has not been corrected.
</p>

<p>
On <a href="#page-272">page 272</a>, <a href="#klage">a few lines from Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Des Mädchend Klage&rdquo;</a> are
cited in German with numerous spelling deviations. This has not been changed, as it
was not clear whether the deviations (most present even in later editions) were
not intentional. The original reads like this:
</p>

  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="verse">Du Heilige, rufe dein Kind zurück,</p>
        <p class="verse">Ich habe genossen das irdische Glück,</p>
        <p class="verse">Ich habe gelebt und geliebet!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p class="noindent">
Likewise, on <a href="#page-125">page 125</a>, the correct German would be:
&ldquo;<a href="#thule">Es war ein König in Thule</a>&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
On <a href="#page-18">page 18</a>, Richardson refers to Byron two times wrongly as Tennyson. On
pages <a href="#page-195">195</a>-<a href="#page-196">196</a>, Bassanio (from the &ldquo;Merchant of Venice&rdquo;)
has in later editions been corrected to Antonio. In both cases, the names have been
preserved as in the original.
</p>

<p>
A few obvious typographical errors were silently corrected. Further careful
corrections, some after consulting other editions, are listed here (before/after):

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
